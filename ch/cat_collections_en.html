<p>In cataloguing collections (a Convolutum or a Collection) redundancy should be avoided as far as possible. To this aim, the following rules apply: </p>

<ol>
<li>Any statements which apply to the entire collection will be entered in the superordinate record (Convolutum or Collection). </li>
<li>Any information that is relevant only for some parts of the collection will be entered in the corresponding subordinate record. </li>
</ol>

<p>A collection which contains at least one "Collection" and a single title and/or other "Collections" is called a "Convolutum". A collection on the other hand consists only of individual works.</p>

<h3>Cataloguing pasticcios and compilations </h3>

<p>Pasticcios and compilations are catalogued as a collection (usually as a "Collection"). Each part is entered separately as a subordinate record in a collection. </p>
