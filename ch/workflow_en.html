<!-- "Work flow": after "Templates" -->

<p>The publication of the data records is controlled by the "work flow" commands. Every change of the "work flow" status must be confirmed by typing the word "yes".</p>

<h3>Unpublished</h3>

<p>If a record (a catalogue record or an authority file) is saved, it is not yet published. This is indicated by the work flow status "unpublished".</p>


<h3>Published</h3>

<p>The work flow status of records has to be changed to "published", so that the records can be viewed by the public.</p>


<h3>Deleted</h3>

<p>Outdated or incorrect records can be hidden from the public. Logged-in cataloguers can however still see a deleted record.</p>
