<h4>Title on manuscript (245 $a) </h4>

<p>The title should be transcribed diplomatically, i.e. as on the source, as far as the character set of the computer does permit it. Generally, it is entirely transcribed. </p>

<p>The location of the title on the source is mentioned before the title in square brackets. The language is English. The location information ends with a colon inside the brackets. </p>

<p>Line breaks are indicated with a slash "/". </p>

<p>If no original title is present on the source, in its place, also in square brackets, the expression "without title" is used. </p>

<p>Comments in English are added directly in square brackets. See the list of "Locations in the source". </p>

<p>E.g.: </p>

<ul>
<li> [org, cover title:] </li>
<li> [S, front page:] </li>
<li> [without title] </li>
</ul>
