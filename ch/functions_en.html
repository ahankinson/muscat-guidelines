<h2 id="sidebar">Sidebar</h2>

<p>The input mask includes a certain number of basic function buttons, which direct work with the software. The following are available:</p>

<h3>General function buttons</h3>

<h3>Save (Save)</h3>

<p>Clicking this button saves the current record. When a record is first saved, the RISM number is assigned automatically. It is recommended to save frequently in order to prevent data loss. </p>

<h3>Preview </h3>

<p>The preview function permits to view entered data in a display mask already during the entry process. A new, floating window will open automatically.</p>


<h3>Specific function buttons in the individual fields </h3>

<h3>Guidelines (?)</h3>

<p>By clicking on the question mark, the applicable rules for the field concerned will appear in a new, floating window. </p>


<h3>Field repetition (+)</h3>

<p>Those fields which allow repetition contain a "+" character. By clicking on this button the whole field will be repeated. In some cases the repetition of individual subfields is possible (e.g., scoring information). To this end there is a small, green "+" sign. </p>


<h3>Delete (dustbin) </h3>

<p>An entire field that is not used can be deleted by clicking on the dustbin icon. This may be helpful during cataloguing. If it is not used, however, a field must not be necessarily deleted, because blank fields will not be displayed for the end user.</p>


<h3>Hide (arrow) </h3>

For better clarity it is sometimes useful to hide some subfields. This button has this function. </p>
