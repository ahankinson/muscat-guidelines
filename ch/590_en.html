<h4>Parts held (590 $a)</h4>

<p>All existing partbooks are mentioned here. The parts are listed in the following order, in separate groups:
</p>

<ul>
<li>solo vocal parts </li>
<li>choral vocal parts </li>
<li>solo instruments </li>
<li>strings </li>
<li>continuo </li>
<li>woodwinds </li>
<li>brass </li>
<li>other instruments </li>
</ul>

<p>The order must match with information given under "Description/Extent (300 $a)". The names of voices and instruments follow the list of abbreviations. Names of parts not listed there are listed with their full name. Vocal parts are capitalized, instrumental parts are not.</p>

<p>In each group, parts are listed from the top to the bottom range. Parts are separated by a comma. </p>

<p>Additional short comments can be made in parentheses directly following the part name. </p>

<p>The groups are separated by semicolons, as is also the case in the subfield "Description/Extent (300 $a)". </p>

<p>In vocal parts, solo and chorus parts are listed separately.</p>

<p>If a partbook contains the parts for several instruments, these are joined by "and". </p>

<p>E.g.: </p>
	
<ul>	
	<li>Solo: S (2x), A, T, Bariton, B; vl 1, 2, va, vc, cb (incpl.), org (=bc.fig); fl 1, 2, ob ; cor 1 and 2 </li>
</ul>
