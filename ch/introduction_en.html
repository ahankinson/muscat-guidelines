<p>These guidelines follow basically the international guidelines for cataloguing music sources within the RISM issued by the RISM Zentralredaktion (Central Editorial Office). Since the software developed by RISM Switzerland is a MARC 21-based system, in certain exceptional cases the preexisting structure of the system had to be taken into account. Care was taken that this is rarely the case. </p>

<p>The structure of the guidelines is simple. The contents provides an overview on the treatment of the different subjects and fields. In the electronic version, the entries in the contents are linked with the respective guidelines. </p>

<p>Every single field that is contained in the software is listed, with its specific guidelines, in the main text, in the order in which they appear in the input mask. The same texts are found in the input mask of each field. To help understanding, certain fields contain examples.</p>

<p>The work aid helps on the one hand with basic instructions in handling the
software, such as the various templates and general functions, and detailed cataloguing rules for special cases, such as collections or pasticcios. On the other hand, this chapter offers practical assistance in the form of various lists. It contains lists of English expressions to describe the diplomatic title, keywords, liturgical feasts, standardised texts, and general abbreviations. Furthermore, a practical guide to the transposition of instruments for the input of music incipits is provided.</p>

<p>The final MARC tag index provides a survey of all fields contained in the cataloguing software, sorted by their MARC21 numbers. In the electronic form of these guidelines, this Index is linked, in order to skip easily to the corresponding help text. </p>
