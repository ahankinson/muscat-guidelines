<h4>Link to volume containing this item (773 $w) </h4>

<p>In single records and Collections, a link to a superordinate record is entered in this field. The link is always made to the next higher level. </p>

<p>E.g., if a Convolutum contains two Collections and three single records, both the Collections and the single records will be linked to the Convolutum. The single records that are inside the Collections will instead be linked with the superordinate Collection. </p>
