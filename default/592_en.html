<h4>Watermark note (592 $a) </h4>

records the existence of watermarks on the source. Please standardize your
information with the help of watermark catalogs or databases (adding a
reference in the field <b>Bibliographical
reference (691) </b>when appropriate). See the list <b>Standard Watermarks</b> for the names of common watermarks. Small
capitals, ciphers/initials, and years must be transcribed exactly. Indicate
line breaks with <b>| </b>(the vertical
pipe). Describe watermarks uniformly and in English. Put your added descriptions in square
