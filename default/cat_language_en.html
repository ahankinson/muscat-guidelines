</p><p><b>Use of English vs. other languages</b><br>English terminology or fixed English
abbreviations are required in some fields while in other fields, other
languages are acceptable.</p><p></p><p>When English is required, it is indicated
in the guidelines for the applicable field. <br><br></p><p>

</p><p><b>Cataloging
language</b><br>When English is not required, you may use
what the guidelines refer to as your <b>cataloging language</b>. RISM allows the
following cataloging languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.
Alternately, other languages are allowed as long as a summary is provided in
one of the six cataloging languages. The guidelines always state when the
cataloging language may be used. <br></p><p></p>

<p>In the guidelines that follow, "cataloging
language" refers to the practice of using either one of these six languages or a different
language plus a translation into one of the six.<br><br></p>

<p><b>Transliterations</b><br>National groups are responsible for
determining what transliteration tables should be used when transliterating
their language.<br></p><br>
