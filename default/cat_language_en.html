</p><p>English terminology or fixed English
abbreviations are required in some fields while in other fields, other
languages are acceptable.</p><p>When English is required, it is indicated
in the guidelines for the applicable field. <br></p>

<p>When English is not required, you may use
what the guidelines refer to as your cataloging language. RISM allows the
following cataloging languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
Alternately, other languages are allowed as long as a summary is provided in
one of the five cataloging languages. The guidelines always state when the
cataloging language may be used. <br></p>

<p>In the guidelines that follow, "cataloging
language" refers to the practice of using either one of these five languages or a different
language plus a translation into one of the five.</p>
