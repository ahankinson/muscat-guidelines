</p><p><b>Add a
group</b>: This button is found at the bottom of the section <b>Material
description</b>. With different groups, you can associate different
dates, formats, watermarks, names, institutions, etc. with different
types of sources (or however you choose to describe your material).
Some of these fields, such as <b>Additional personal name (700)</b>,
<b>Additional institution (710)</b>, and <b>General note (500)</b>
are also found elsewhere in the Sources template. Use your best
judgment to decide where to place such information: does it apply to
the entire source, or just this group of material?  
</p>

<p><br></p>



<h3>Other
functions in the editing mode</h3>



<p><b>Autocomplete</b>: If you see a field that contains a
key, the field is linked to the authority file or index. Begin typing and use
the autocomplete to help you. </p>

<p></p><p><b>Adding new names, titles, subject headings, etc.</b><span>: If you do not find what you need in the
authority files, simply enter the name or term you need. Once you
click to a different field, an orange border appears around the fields and you
will see a checkbox that reads "Confirm the insertion of a new value."
Click this box to confirm. For personal names, a field called <b>Life dates</b> will appear. Please fill
this out if you can because it helps the Central Office create a new authority
record. When you save, the name or title will be automatically added to the
authority files. See also <b>General
Cataloging Guidelines </b>under <b>Personal
names.</b></span></p>



<p><b>Required
fields and validation</b>: When you begin a new
record, the most important fields will already be open and ready for you to
fill in.Fields that are yellow are required fields. If
you save without filling out one of these fields, a red border will appear
around the fields that still need attention, and the sections in which the
fields occur will be red in the sidebar on the right. In cases where no
information can be filled out in a required field, the validation may be
overridden by checking a box in the sidebar.</p>
