<h3><a target="_blank">Other
functions in the editing mode</a></h3>



<p><b>Autocomplete</b>: If you see a field that contains a
key, the field is linked to the authority file or index. Begin typing and use
the autocomplete to help you. </p>

<p><b>Checkbox</b><span>: If you do not find what you need in the
authority file or index, simply enter the name or title you want. Once you
click to a different field, an orange border appears around the fields and you
will see a checkbox that reads "Confirm the insertion of a new
value." Click this box to confirm. For personal names, a field called <b>Life dates</b> will appear. Please fill
this out if you can because it helps the Central Office create a new authority
record. When you save, the name or title will be automatically added to the
authority files. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ???After you enter a new
value, you can edit it for the next four weeks. This is useful if you find
alternate spellings of a name, for example, or if you have additional
biographical information you wish to add. After that, control of the record
goes to the Central Office. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated
through the comment function or by sending an e-mail to ???@rism.info.</span></p>



<p><b>???Required
fields and validation</b>: Fields that are yellow are required fields. If
you save without filling out one of these fields, a red border will appear
around the fields that still need attention, and the sections in which the
fields occur will be red in the sidebar on the right. In cases where no
information can be filled out in a required field, the validation may be
overridden by checking a box in the sidebar.</p>
