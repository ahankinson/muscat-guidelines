<h1>Bew√§hrte Vorgehensweisen

</h1><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>1. Free
text fields and indexed fields</b><br><span>If you name
a person or institution in your record (such as in a notes field), make sure to
also enter the name in the indexed fields <b>Additional
personal name (700)</b> or <b>Additional
institution (710)</b>.<br></span></p><p><span>The same
applies for citing secondary literature: if you refer to a publication in a
notes field, make sure to also enter it in the field <b>Bibliographic reference (691)</b>.</span></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>2. URLs and
links to external resources</b><br><span>Always use
permalinks when linking to digitized music, in particular for the field <b>External resource (856)</b>.</span><br><br><span>If you want
to link to a different website, do not enter the URL in a notes field. Rather,
enter the resource as a bibliographic reference by entering it in the <b>Secondary literature</b> database. Then,
link to it in the field <b>Bibliographic
reference (691)</b> and refer to it by its short title in a notes field. This
provides users with access to complete bibliographic information, and if the
URL changes then we only have to change it once in the bibliographic record.</span> <br></p>

<p><span>For books
found on Google Books or other online repositories, always create a
bibliographic record in the <b>Secondary
literature</b> database for the book itself and not the repository; i.e. cite
the book and not Google Books. </span></p>
