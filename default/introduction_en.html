<p>Muscat is
the program offered by RISM to working groups and contributors, available free
of charge to anyone who is interested. It enables direct access to the RISM
database hosted by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz. To
access the database you need a login name and password, available from the RISM
Zentralredaktion. Muscat helps document sources according to RISM's
international guidelines, which are contained in this document.</p>

<p>Muscat is a MARC-based system that was developed jointly with RISM
Switzerland and the RISM Zentralredkation (Central Office).</p>

<p><span>Refer to the contents on the right for an overview. The section <b>2 - Cataloguing sources </b>lists the guidelines
in the order they appear in Muscat. When working with Muscat, you will also
find the guidelines for each field linked to their respective field by a
question mark. Examples are included throughout. Should anything be unclear, or
you notice and inconsistencies, do not hesitate to get in contact with the Central
Office: contact@rism.info.</span></p>

<p>The middle sections (3-6) explain how to use the program (general
functions, templates, how to catalog certain formats). It also offers various
lists containing standardized vocabulary and abbreviations for use in areas
such as the diplomatic title, subject headings, and liturgical festivals. In
addition, you will find a table of transposing instruments to help you when entering
incipits. </p>

<p>At the end (section 7) is an index of all MARC fields used in Muscat, sorted by MARC21 tag.
These fields are also linked to their corresponding parts in this document.</p><p></p><p>

Germany. Jennifer Ward (jennifer.ward@rism.info) maintains the English version
and Martina Falletta (martina.falletta@rism.info) maintains the German version.
