Die Normdatei der <b>Sschlagworte</b>
enthält alle Gattungen und andere standardisierte Begriffe, die im Feld <b>Schlagwort (650)</b> verwendet werden.
A record for a subject heading typically includes the standardized
RISM term in English and in plural, translations or alternate terms,
and a definition. Genres and forms found outside of Western Europe or
common in a particular region where there is no English equivalent
are given in the local language (and in the plural when it makes
linguistic sense).<p>Subject
headings can be added while cataloging. In the record, simply enter
the new subject heading and click to a different field. You then get
a message that says "Confirm the insertion of a new value"
which you should then click.</p>

<p>After you
save the record, go to the authority file for subject headings and
find your new heading. You can edit subject headings you create.
Please do the following:</p>
<p><b>Begriff</b>:
Enter the term in English and in the plural when possible. For
regional music, particularly music found outside Western Europe, use
the term common in the region. For languages that use non-Latin
alphabets, enter the transliterated term here using the Latin
alphabet. 
</p>
<p><b>Synonym</b>: Please enter all alternate
terms, each on a separate line (by pressing Enter). Here you can
enter the term using other alphabet systems as well as synonyms,
variations, other spellings, etc.</p>
<p><b>Anmerkungen</b>:
Please provide a short description in English, German, or French of
what kind of term this is. Then feel free to also write in your
native language, for the benefit of RISM contributors in your area,
any description or guidelines you wish to set for the term: how to
apply the term, any regional connections, references to secondary
literature, etc.</p>

<p>Beispiel: <b>Gigues</b>.<b> </b>Begriffe sind auf Englisch, Französisch und Deutsch
angegeben sowie andere Schreibweisen. Das Feld "Anmerkungen"
erklärt die Vielfalt der existierenden Giguen und wann und wo sie aufgetreten sind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are
working with music particular to a certain region, you can use
whatever term is common in that region. A new term can be added if a
similar genre is used in a different region but it is called
something else.</p>

<p>You
can also add the subject heading directly to the authority file
(simply click <b>Create</b>
in this authority file) and it will be immediately available for use.</p>

<p>Cataloging
tips:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Records
	for sources can include multiple subject headings, such as if there
	is a specific term as well as a more general or overarching term.

	</li><li>
<p>To
	aid users in discovery, you are also free to include the local term
	in foreign languages and alphabets as an <b>Alternative
	title (730) </b>if you wish.<br></p></li></ul><br>
