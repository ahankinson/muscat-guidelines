<h4><b><br></b>Link
type (856 $x)</h4><p>This field is required when entering a link
to an external resource. Select from the following:</p>

<ul><li><b>Digitized source</b>: The link is to an external website which is a digitized copy of the
resource being described. The preference is to link to institutional
repositories but if one is not available then links to external repositories
such as the Internet Archive or IMSLP are allowed.<span><i><br><br>Example</i>:</span><u><a target="_blank" href="https://mirador.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/musikarchivspitz/A-SPD_A15/"><span><br>https://mirador.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/musikarchivspitz/A-SPD_A15/<br><br></span></a></u></li><li><b>IIIF manifest</b>: The linked object is a machine-readable JSON object processed by an
internal document viewer such as diva.js. The document is embedded in the web
page directly. In many cases, "manifest," "iiif," or
similar appears in the link.<span><i><br><br>Example</i>:</span><u><a target="_blank" href="https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650"><span><br>https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650</span></a></u><span><br><br>In cases where both links to an external viewer and an IIIF manifest are
available, repeat the field and list both links separately.</span><span><i><br><br>Example</i>:</span><br><ul><li><span>External resource:
<a target="_blank" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Loeb:537966">http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Loeb:537966</a></span><span><br>Note: digitized version</span><span><br>Link type: digitized source</span></li><li><span>External resource:

<h4>Kinds of external resources</h4>



<p><b>Link
type 856 $x: Digitized source</b><br>Link only to the source being described in
the RISM record. Only use permalinks. If permalinks are unavailable, you may
link to a page where the link to the digitized source can be easily found (such
as a bibliographic record in a library catalog). You may include portions of
the digitized source (such as a few pages) if a fully digitized version is not
available.</p>



<p>Links entered as digitized sources appear in
the filter "Digitized sources" in the public OPAC (opac.rism.info).<br><br></p>



<p><b>Link
type 856 $x: Other</b></p>

<p><span>Other kinds of external resources can include
the following. Make sure it is always clear to the user why a link is being
included, such as in a <b>General note
(500)</b>.</span></p><ul><li><b>Details of sources</b><br>Details of sources that only present certain
aspects, such as a watermark, binding, title page, or cover.</li><li><b>Catalog records/Databases</b><br>Includes bibliographic entries in external catalogs
or entries in external databases. External scholarly databases that provide
useful information might be included, but consider whether they might be better
linked as secondary literature.</li><li><b>Electronic catalogs of works, online encyclopedias, digitized
reference sources</b><span><br>In general, use the fields <b>Secondary literature (691)</b> or <b>Catalog
of works (690)</b> to refer to online reference works such as catalogs of works
or encyclopedias. However, as a service to users, it might be helpful to
additionally include a direct link to a certain place within the resource
through the 856 field.</span></li><li><b>Archival sources, historical sources</b><span><br>Includes digitized
municipal registers or documents, digitized correspondence, historical
newspapers. Ensure that the relevance of the archival source is first clear in
a <b>General note (500)</b>, then include
the direct link here. For historical newspapers, you should enter the name of
the newspaper as secondary literature but you may link to the specific page
where the article is found here; make sure information about the article, such
as article title and date, is included in a note.</span></li><li><b>Websites</b><br>Includes project websites, websites of external
funding agencies, or other relevant websites.</li><li><b>Other RISM records</b><span><br>Only link to another RISM record if the record has
direct bearing to the source being described. Only use permalinks from the RISM
OPAC (<a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/)">https://opac.rism.info/)</a>. It should be clear to the user why the record
is relevant to the source. At a minimum, name the holding library, shelfmark,
and RISM ID number in a note. Sometimes a connection to a different source might
be better explained in a <b>General note
(500)</b>.</span><span><br>If you refer to other RISM records elsewhere in you record, it is not required
to link to them in this field.</span><span><br>It is not necessary to link to all concordant sources in RISM here; indeed,
this is a futile pursuit because the number of sources grows in Muscat daily.</span></li><li><b>References to relevant sources in other libraries but not in RISM</b><br>If you want to link to a source not yet in RISM,
consider whether it is possible for your working group to first enter the
digitized libretto, manuscript, or treatise, or add holdings to a particular
print. The Central Office is happy to help you if you think a source should be
in RISM. However, it is understandable if you are unable to create a new record
for a source first.</li><li><b>Other relevant sources</b><br>Includes concordant sources,
concordant works, concordant arias or sections of works, sources that served as
the basis for the source being described. Such links can be to the digitized
objects or links to external catalogs.<br></li></ul><br>
