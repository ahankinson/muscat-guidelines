<h4>Link type (856 $x)</h4>

<p>This
field is required when entering a link to an external resource. Select from the
following:</p>

<ul><li><b>Digitized source</b>: The link is to an
     external website which is a digitized copy of the resource being
     described. The preference is to link to institutional repositories but if
     one is not available then links to external repositories such as the
     Internet Archive or IMSLP are allowed. For collections,
     it is not necessary to duplicate the same link in the collection main
     entry and the individual entries.<i><span><br>
     Example</span></i>:<a target="_blank" href="https://mirador.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/musikarchivspitz/A-SPD_A15/"><span><br>
     https://mirador.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/musikarchivspitz/A-SPD_A15/</span></a></li><li><b>IIIF manifest</b><span>: The linked object is a
     machine-readable JSON object processed by an internal document viewer such
     as diva.js. The document is embedded in the web page directly. In many
     cases, "manifest," "iiif," or similar appears in the link.<i><br>
     Example</i>:</span><a target="_blank" href="https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650"><span><br>
     https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650</span></a><span><br>
     <br>
     In cases where both links to an external viewer and an IIIF manifest are
     available, repeat the field and list both links separately.<br>
     <i>Example</i>:</span></li><ul><li><span>External resource:
      <a target="_blank" href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Loeb:537966">http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.Loeb:537966</a><br>
      Note: digitized version<br>
      Link type: digitized source</span></li><li><span>External resource:
      <a target="_blank" href="https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650">https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/drs:2820650</a><br>
      Note: IIIF manifest<br>
      Link type: IIIF manifest</span></li></ul></ul>



<ul><li><b>Other</b>: Link to other resources that are
     not the resource being described.</li></ul>

<h4>Kinds of external
resources<b></b></h4>



<p><b>Link type 856 $x: Digitized source</b><br>Link
only to the source being described in the RISM record. Only use permalinks. If
permalinks are unavailable, you may link to a page where the link to the
digitized source can be easily found (such as a bibliographic record in a
library catalog). You may include portions of the digitized source (such as a
few pages) if a fully digitized version is not available.

<br></p>

<p>Links
entered as digitized music appear in the filter "Digitized music" in
the public OPAC (opac.rism.info).</p>

<p><b>Link type 856 $x: Other</b></p>

<p><span>Other
kinds of external resources can include the following. Make sure it is always
clear to the user why a link is being included, such as in a <b>General note (500)</b>. </span></p>



<ul><li><b><span>Details
     of sources<br>
     </span></b>Details
     of sources that only present certain aspects, such as a watermark,
     binding, title page, or cover. </li><li><b><span>Catalog
     records/Databases<br>
     </span></b>Includes
     bibliographic entries in external catalogs or entries in external
     databases. External scholarly databases that provide useful information
     might be included, but consider whether they might be better linked as
     secondary literature.</li><li><b><span>Electronic
     catalogs of works, online encyclopedias, digitized reference sources<br>
     </span></b><span>In
     general, use the fields <b>Secondary
     literature (691)</b> or <b>Catalog of
     works (690)</b> to refer to online reference works such as catalogs of
     works or encyclopedias. However, as a service to users, it might be
     helpful to additionally include a direct link to a certain place within
     the resource through the 856 field. </span></li><li><b>Archival
     sources, historical sources</b><span><br>Includes digitized municipal
registers or documents, digitized correspondence, historical newspapers. Ensure
that the relevance of the archival source is first clear in a <b>General note (500)</b>, then include the
direct link here. For historical newspapers, you should enter the name of the
newspaper as secondary literature but you may link to the specific page where
the article is found here; make sure information about the article, such as
article title and date, is included in a note.</span></li><li><b><span>Websites<br>
     </span></b>Includes
     project websites, websites of external funding agencies, or other relevant
     websites.</li><li><b><span>Other
     RISM records<br>
     </span></b><span>Only
     link to another RISM record if the record has direct bearing to the source
     being described. Only use permalinks from the RISM OPAC
     (<a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/)">https://opac.rism.info/)</a>. It should be clear to the user why the record
     is relevant to the source. At a minimum, name the holding library,
     shelfmark, and RISM ID number in a note. Sometimes a connection to a
     different source might be better explained in a <b>General note (500)</b>. <br>
     If you refer to other RISM records elsewhere in you record, it is not
     required to link to them in this field.<br>
     It is not necessary to link to all concordant sources in RISM here;
     indeed, this is a futile pursuit because the number of sources grows in
     Muscat daily. </span></li><li><b><span>References
     to relevant sources in other libraries but not in RISM<br>
     </span></b>If
     you want to link to a source not yet in RISM, consider whether it is
     possible for your working group to first enter the digitized libretto,
     manuscript, or treatise, or add holdings to a particular print. The Editorial
     Center is happy to help you if you think a source should be in RISM.
     However, it is understandable if you are unable to create a new record for
     a source first. </li><li><b>Other
     relevant sources</b><br>Includes concordant sources,
concordant works, concordant arias or sections of works, sources that served as
the basis for the source being described. Such links can be to the digitized
objects or links to external catalogs.<br></li></ul>
