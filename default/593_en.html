</p><p><span>A
manuscript is considered to be an <b>autograph
manuscript </b>if it was written completely or for the most part in the
composer’s own hand. <b>Possible autograph
manuscript</b> indicates that there is a degree of uncertainty. In the case of
autograph manuscripts and possible autograph manuscripts, do not create an
added entry <b>(700)</b> with the composer's
name as the copyist. However, an exception is if the identity of the copyist is
certain but it is uncertain if the copyist is also the composer. In such a
case, enter the copyist's name in the field <b>Additional personal names (700)</b> but add the same name to the field <b>Composer/Author name (100 $a)</b> with the appropriate
attribution. </span></p>

<p></p>



<p><span>A ???<b>partial autograph</b> means that
corrections or small additions are in the composer’s hand. An explanatory note
in the field <b>General note (500)</b> may
be appropriate.</span></p>



<p><span>If the
arranger of a composition was also the copyist, select <b>Manuscript copy</b> and not <b>Autograph
manuscript</b>. </span></p>
