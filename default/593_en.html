<h4>Autograph note (593 $a) --</h4>

<p><b>The note indicates the physical form of the source. The types are described in English. The following entries are possible and can be chosen from the drop-down list: </b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Autograph </li>
	<li>Possible autograph </li>
	<li>Manuscript with autograph annotations </li>
	<li>Manuscript </li>
	<li>Print </li>
</ul>

<p>A manuscript is considered an autograph only if the composer wrote it all or for the most part. Autograph corrections or additions on a smaller scale are indicated with "Manuscript with autograph annotations". In this case, an explanatory note in the field "General note (500 $a)" may be appropriate. </p>

<p>If the source is definitely an autograph, because of the combined search for autograph works of specific composers it is necessary to repeat the corresponding author's name in the field "Subject added entry - personal name (600)". </p>

<p>If the arranger of a composition is also the scribe of the source, this copy is not considered an autograph.</p>

<p>In manuscript collections, the autograph note is filled only in the individual entry or entries.</p>

<p>In autographs and probable autographs the composer's name should not be indicated as copyist's name. <strong>Exception: </strong>If the writer is certain, however, but it is uncertain whether he or she is also the composer, the name will be entered in the field "Additional personal names (700)". The same name appears as composer in the field "Name (100 $a)", and the box under "Dubious ($j)" has to be ticked to express the uncertainty of the attribution. </p>
