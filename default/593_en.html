<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><span>For music, a manuscript
is considered to be an <b>autograph
manuscript </b>if it was written completely or for the most part in the
composer’s own hand. <b>Possible autograph
manuscript</b> indicates that there is a degree of uncertainty. In the case of
autograph manuscripts and possible autograph manuscripts, do not create an
added entry <b>(700)</b> with the
composer's name as the copyist. However, an exception is if the identity of the
copyist is certain but it is uncertain if the copyist is also the composer. In
such a case, enter the copyist's name in the field <b>Additional personal names (700)</b> but add the same name to the field <b>Composer/Author name (100 $a)</b> with the
appropriate attribution. </span>





<p><span>A <b>partial autograph</b> means that corrections or small additions
are in the composer’s hand. An explanatory note in the field <b>General note (500)</b> may be appropriate.</span></p>



<p><span>If the
arranger of a composition was also the copyist, select <b>Manuscript copy</b> and not <b>Autograph
manuscript</b>. </span></p>
