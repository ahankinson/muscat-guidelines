The Directory of
Music Repositories of RISM-C/AMA is a subproject of the Access to Music
Archives (AMA) initiative, a project to locate and describe music archival
fonds and collections on the fonds/collection level, using the International
Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH). A
necessary part of the description is data about the holding institutions,
places and directory. The proposal is to update the <i>Directory of Music Research Libraries</i>&nbsp;developed by RISM. The project will begin with the two volumes containing
fifteen European countries, published in 2001 (2nd&nbsp;edition), compiled and revised by Elizabeth Davies.

<p>The relationship
between this updating project and the AMA project is the idea to add archival
information to the description of each institution, and a special section
with information about the musical fonds preserved in each institution,
presented as a simple list with the names of the fonds or collections. This
will provide an initial guide of location information for fonds and collections
prior to the complete description of them.</p>

<p>The idea is to
involve both the national branches of IAML and RISM national groups in this
updating of the RISM-C directory. In this way, the subproject will be a
collaboration between all national branches of IAML and national offices of
RISM. The result will be accessible online through the RISM and IAML websites,
and will be a powerful tool to locate music libraries, archives and
documentation centres as well as their holdings.</p>

<p>This guide
presents guidelines for the practical matters involved in the updating of the
paper version of the directory, transforming it into an online database created
by the RISM Central Office. Fields in this database are arranged according to
MARC21 and the guidelines are in accordance with ISDIAH in order to allow
compatibility.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
