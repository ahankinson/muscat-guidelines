<h4>Description/Extent (300 $a) </h4>

<p>This subfield indicates the category of the described source. It is preceded by the number of existing copies. The number of pages or folios follows after a colon, using the following abbreviations: "f." for folio, "p." for page, "lvs." for leaves, and "fds." for folds.</p>

<p>The following terms can be used. If different terms apply to the same layer of material, the subfield is repeatable: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>score(s) </strong> <br>
A "score" contains all the vocal and instrumental parts of a work. This applies also to works for voice and accompaniment. Scores of works for a single instrument however are designed as a part.</li>
	<li><strong>piano score(s)</strong><br>
		<strong>vocal score(s)</strong><br>
		<strong>particell</strong><br>
		<strong>short score(s)</strong><br>
		"short score(s)" is chosen only if it is not possible to determine more precisely the type of reduced score. </li>
	<li><strong>part(s)</strong><br>
Any individual parts (vocal or instrumental), regardless of the number of staves (e.g., piano, organ, piano four-hands), are referred to as parts. Also individual orchestral parts belong to this category. The page numbers of the individual parts in a group should be separated by a semicolon, as are the existing parts in the field "Parts held (590 $a)". </li>
<li><strong>choir book(s) </strong> <br>
Choir books are entered in the same way as scores.</li>
<li><strong>sketches</strong> <br>
The term "sketches" is used when there are various sketches on a document that cannot be ascribed to any of the above categories.</li>
	<li><strong>libretto / libretti</strong></li>
	<li><strong>theoreticum / theoretica</strong></li>
	<li><strong>others</strong><br>
If none of the above categories applies, the term "others" is used.</li>
</ol>

<p>E.g.:</p> 	
<ul>	
	<li>1 score: 35p.</li>
	<li>5 parts: 12, 12, 9, 9, 15p.</li>
	<li>1 short score: 8f.</li>
</ul>

<p>In single entries that are part of a Collection/Convolutum, the exact page number on which the relevant work is present follows the indicator "p.", respectively "f." or "lvs." or "fds."</p>

<p>E.g.: </ p>
<ul>
	<li>1 score: p.5-8</li>
	<li>5 parts: p.2-3, 2-3, 2, 2, 3-5</li>
	<li>1 short score: f.2r-4v</li>
</ul>
