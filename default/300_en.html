<p><b>Format, extent (300 $a)</b></p>

<p></p><p>

</p>

<p>This field
records the number of items, the format, and the extent.</p>



<p><span>Note that the
entire section&nbsp;<b>Material description</b> is
repeatable, as is the field <b>Physical
description (300) </b>and this subfield <b>Format,
extent (300 $a)</b>. This means that you are free to create one <b>Material description</b> section per format,
or you can list each format on a separate line in <b>Physical description (300)</b>. </span></p>



<p><span>Let's say
you have 1 score and 10 parts. For catalogers going into a lot of detail,
creating one <b>Material description</b> section
for the score and one <b>Material
description</b> section for the parts allows you to assign different dates,
copyists, watermarks, and other information specific to just that score or just
those parts (or you can even describe the parts in smaller groups if necessary).
If the date, copyist, etc. are the same for both the score and the parts, or if
you are not going into so much detail, then it is enough to simply list one
underneath the other in the field <b>Format,
extent (300 $a)</b>. Different dimensions can be recorded if you repeat the
field <b>Physical description (300)</b>.</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><span>The field<b> Format, extent (300 $a)</b> is built up of
three components: <b>Items, Format, Extent.</b></span>

<p><b>Items</b><span>: State the number of items held. Use <b>X</b> to indicate an unknown number of
items.</span> <br></p>

<p><b>Format</b>: Use one of the following.</p>



<ul><li><span>part(s)<br>
     <b>Part</b> indicates the notation of
     a work for an instrument or voice regardless of the number of staves per
     system (piano, organ, piano 4 hands)</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;score(s)<br>
     A <b>score</b> contains all the
     instruments and/or voices of a composition, as long as more than one
     performing force is involved. This includes works for voice and
     accompaniment. </span></li><li><span>KALLISTO: short score(s)<br>
     Any kind of reduced score (such as piano reduction) is called a short
     score.</span></li><li>choirbook(s)</li><li>text document</li><li>other</li><li><span>???<strong> piano score(s)</strong></span></li><li><strong>???vocal score(s)</strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>???particella</strong><strong></strong></li><li><strong>short score(s): </strong>??? use only if it is not

<p>&nbsp;<b>Extent</b><span>: Enter the number of pages, leaves, or
gatherings. Directly after the enumeration (no space), choose among the
following abbreviations: <b>f</b> for
folio, <b>p</b> for page, <b>lvs</b> for leaves (sheets), and <b>fds</b> for folds (gatherings). In this
system, one <b>lvs</b> corresponds to two <b>f</b>, whereas one <b>fds</b> means at least one <b>lvs</b>. You may also indicate single pages
or folios within a manuscript collection. Use only one method of enumeration.
Indicate other units (such as the conversion from folios to pages) in the field <b>General
note (500)</b>.</span></p>

<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>1 score:
p.5-8<br>5 parts:
p.2-3, 2-3, 2, 2, 3-5<br>1 short

35p.<br>5 parts:
12, 12, 9, 9, 15p.<br>1 short
score: 8f.</p><b><br>Dimensions (300 $c)</b>

<p><span>Enter the
dimensions of the source (height x width in cm). A second set of dimensions can
be given in parentheses. If there are more than two different sets of
dimensions, enter <b>Different sizes</b>.
Further elaboration can be made in the field <b>General note (500)</b>. Formats such as <b>octavo</b>, <b>quarto</b> or <b>small quarto</b>, etc. should be measured
if possible. </span></p>
