<p><b>Format, extent (300 $a)</b></p>

<p></p><p>

</p>

<p>This field
records the number of items, the format, and the extent.</p>



<p><span>Note that the
entire section&nbsp;<b>Material description</b> is
repeatable, as is the field <b>Physical
description (300) </b>and this subfield <b>Format,
extent (300 $a)</b>. This means that you are free to create one <b>Material description</b> section per format,
or you can list each format on a separate line in <b>Physical description (300)</b>. </span></p>



<p><span>Let's say
you have 1 score and 10 parts. For catalogers going into a lot of detail,
creating one <b>Material description</b> section
for the score and one <b>Material
description</b> section for the parts allows you to assign different dates,
copyists, watermarks, and other information specific to just that score or just
those parts (or you can even describe the parts in smaller groups if necessary).
If the date, copyist, etc. are the same for both the score and the parts, or if
you are not going into so much detail, then it is enough to simply list one
underneath the other in the field <b>Format,
extent (300 $a)</b>. Different dimensions can be recorded if you repeat the
field <b>Physical description (300)</b>.</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><span>The field<b> Format, extent (300 $a)</b> is built up of
three components: <b>Items, Format, Extent.</b></span>

items.</span> <br></p>

<p><b>Format</b>: Use one of the following.</p>

     regardless of the number of staves per system (includes piano, organ,

     in the field <b>General note (500).</b></span></li><li>choirbook(s): A book in which all voices of a work are written
     separately so that the choir can read the music from one book.</li><li>sketches: Use for sketches if the type of format cannot be more

     of text documents. A note in <b>General note (500)</b> may be necessary.</span></li><li>prompt book: A document (can be a short score or text) used by

<ul><li><span>other: Use if none of the above apply. In such cases, explain
     with a note in the field <b>General note (500)</b>.</span></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;<span>For conductor part(s), use <b>part</b> or <b>parts</b>
here and select conductor part in the field <b>Parts held (590).</b></span></p>





<p>&nbsp;<b>Extent</b><span>: Enter the number of pages, leaves, or
gatherings. Directly after the enumeration (no space), choose among the
following abbreviations: <b>f</b> for
folio, <b>p</b> for page, <b>lvs</b> for leaves (sheets), and <b>fds</b> for folds (gatherings). In this
system, one <b>lvs</b> corresponds to two <b>f</b>, whereas one <b>fds</b> means at least one <b>lvs</b>. You may also indicate single pages
or folios within a manuscript collection. Use only one method of enumeration.
Indicate other units (such as the conversion from folios to pages) in the field <b>General
note (500)</b>.</span></p>

<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>1 score:
p.5-8<br>5 parts:
p.2-3, 2-3, 2, 2, 3-5<br>1 short

<p><span>Enter the
dimensions of the source (height x width in cm). A second set of dimensions can
be given in parentheses. If there are more than two different sets of
dimensions, enter <b>Different sizes</b>.
Further elaboration can be made in the field <b>General note (500)</b>. Formats such as <b>octavo</b>, <b>quarto</b> or <b>small quarto</b>, etc. should be measured
