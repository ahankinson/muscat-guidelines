<br>
<b><a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rism-muscat">RISM Muscat</a></b>, <span>a Google Group, is
the official Muscat discussion list that each Muscat user must join. Official
announcements from the Central Office and the Muscat developers will be disseminated solely through this group. In addition, all Muscat users are
encouraged to ask questions or raise topics for discussion. <br>
<br>
A Google account is not required. An invitation to join the group will be sent
to you when you receive your Muscat account information.</span><br>
</span></li><li><b>Is
all literature cited in Muscat at the Central Office?</b><br>No, only
the literature labeled "HB" or "Handbibliothek" or
"RISM-ZR" is actually in our office. Those materials are for the
benefit of all RISM contributors, so if we have a publication that you would
like to consult, let us know and we will try to get you what you need. Even if
you are interested in a publication we do not have in the office, there's a
chance that we know someone who has it.<br></li><li><b>What do
I do if I forget my password or want to change it?</b><br>Passwords
are managed by the Central Office. Contact us if you loose your password.
You cannot change your password.<br><br></li><li><b>Can I show Muscat to my colleagues? Can I demonstrate Muscat at
     conferences or in workshops?</b><br><span>Yes, please do! A training version of Muscat is available for exactly
     these purposes at <a target="_blank" href="http://muscat-training.rism.info/">http://muscat-training.rism.info</a>. </span><br><br>All Muscat users can login there with their personal credentials. There
     are also 50 training accounts ("training01@rism.info" to
     "training50@rism.info") all with password "password".
     Any of these training accounts can be used.<br><br>Anything on the training version can be added, edited or deleted. It is synchronized once a week (on Sunday) with the current Muscat data. This
     means that the new records will then be available but also that the ones
     created on the training version will be erased.
