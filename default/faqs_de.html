<br>
<b><a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rism-muscat">RISM Muscat</a></b>, <span>a
 Google Group, is
the official Muscat discussion list that each Muscat user must join. 
Official
announcements from the Central Office and the Muscat developers will be 
disseminated solely through this group. In addition, all Muscat users 
are
encouraged to ask questions or raise topics for discussion. <br>
<br>
A Google account is not required. An invitation to join the group will be sent
to you when you receive your Muscat account information.<br><br>There is also a
discussion channel on Slack at: <br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://rismcommunity.slack.com/">https://rismcommunity.slack.com/</a></span><br><br>
</span></li><li><b>Is
all literature cited in Muscat at the Central Office?</b><br>No, only
the literature labeled "HB" or "Handbibliothek" or
"RISM-ZR" is actually in our office. Those materials are for the
benefit of all RISM contributors, so if we have a publication that you would
like to consult, let us know and we will try to get you what you need. Even if
you are interested in a publication we do not have in the office, there's a
chance that we know someone who has it.<br><br></li><li><b>What do
I do if I forget my password or want to change it?</b><br>Passwords
are managed by the Central Office. Contact us if you lose your password.
You cannot change your password.<br><br></li><li><b>Can I show Muscat to my colleagues? Can I demonstrate Muscat at
     conferences or in workshops?</b><br><span>Yes, please do! A training version of Muscat is available for exactly
     these purposes at <a target="_blank" href="https://muscat-training.rism.info/">https://muscat-training.rism.info</a>. <br><br>All Muscat users can
login there with their personal credentials. There are also 99 training
accounts ("training01@rism.info" to "training99@rism.info")
available for individual users. Any of these training accounts can be used.
Please contact the RISM Central Office (Jennifer Ward, jennifer.ward@rism.info) for the current password.</span><br><br>Anything
 on the training version can be added, edited or deleted. It is 
synchronized once a week (on Sunday) with the current Muscat data. This
     means that the new records will then be available but also that the
 ones
     created on the training version will be erased. <br><br></li><li><b>In the modification history, what
     does it mean if "[system]" is listed as the author?</b><br>You might see a system edit if one of the indexed fields linked to your
     record was changed. The change in the authority record will also register
     as a change in your record.<br><br></li><li><b><span>Can I create records based on descriptions from printed
     catalogs?<br>
     </span></b><span>Yes! Sometimes, for various reasons, it is not
     possible to access the source and only the description in a printed catalog or
     catalog of works is available. You may use such descriptions as the basis
     for your record. When doing so, include a <b>General note (500)</b> such as "Record based on description
     in YouV" and link to the catalog in the field <b>Bibliographic reference (691)</b>.</span></li></ol>
