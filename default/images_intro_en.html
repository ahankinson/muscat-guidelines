<p><span><span>The <b>Images</b> database contains all images
that have been uploaded to Muscat. You may upload a new file or browse existing
files. </span>The database is intended to store
and display individual images that serve to illustrate a point in a record,
such as a watermark, a binding, or a handwriting sample. You can link images to
source records as well as authority records. Full digital versions of sources should
not be uploaded here but rather linked in the field </span><b>External resource (856)</b>. </p>The
following formats are allowed: JPEG<br>

<p><span>You may add
an image either by clicking on <b>Attach a
new image</b> when you are editing a source, or directly in the images database
by clicking on <b>Create</b>. Always add a short
description, such as a description of the watermark, the location on the
source, or the siglum. This will help you find them later.</span> Images are displayed in the order they are
linked to the record.</p><p>
