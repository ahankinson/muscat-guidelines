<p><span>The <b>Digital objects</b> database
contains all images and MEI files that have been uploaded to Muscat. The
database is intended to store and display individual images that serve to
illustrate a point in a record, such as a watermark, a binding, or a
handwriting sample; it is also where MEI incipits are attached. You can link digital
objects to source records as well as authority records. Full digital versions
of sources should not be uploaded here but rather linked in the field <b>External
resource (856)</b>.</span> <br></p><span>Add an image (.jpeg or .png) by clicking on
<b>Attach a new image</b> when you are
editing a source. Always add a short description, such as a description of the
watermark, the location on the source, or the siglum. This will help you find
them later. Images are displayed in the order they are linked to the record. </span>

you wish to add an MEI incipit.</p>When you are viewing an image, you have the
