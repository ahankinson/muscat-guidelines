<h1>Suchen

</h1><p>The Muscat
filters offer simple yet powerful searching.</p>You can
enter in each field:

<ul><li>Single words</li><li>Multiple words: <br><span>either without quotations mark: <b>lass
     noch</b> (98 results)</span><br><span>or with quotation marks: <b>"lass
     noch"</b> (6 results)</span></li><li><span>Truncation with ? or *<br>
     <b>?</b>: The question mark replaces
     exactly one letter. <b>B?cher</b> will
     find Bucher and Bacher. <br><b>*</b>: The
     asterisk can be used to truncate or replace any number of letters. <b>B*cher</b> will find Bucher and Bacher
     but also Boucher and Bötticher.</span></li><li><span>AND, OR, NOT, ( ): Take
     advantage of Boolean searching. Use parenthesis to group your search.
     Examples:<br>
     Composer contains: <b>(Bach AND
     Johann) NOT Sebastian</b><br>
     To find Johann Michael Bach and Johann Christian Bach but not Johann
     Sebastian Bach<br>
     Siglum contains: <b>D-B AND (I-* OR
     F-P*) </b><br>
     To find all prints in the library D-B where there are also copies in Italy
     or Paris</span></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note
the following for these particular fields:</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Composer contains</b>: This searches only RISM's authorized form of
the name: Anonymus instead of Anonymous, Čajkovskij instead of Tchaikovsky. Use
the Personal Names authority file to find the authorized forms. </p>

<p></p><p><b>Siglum
contains</b>: Search by the letters in a siglum. This field is case-sensitive. For
example:<br><b>D-*</b> = all
sources in Germany<br><b>D-B* </b>= all
sources in German cities that start with B<br><b>D-B</b> = all
sources at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</p>

<p><b>Searching by date:</b> Enter dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The day
is set to midnight by default.<br><b>Single date ("from"): </b><span>If you fill in only the left-hand
field (the "from"), you will get all records modified or created <b>since</b> that date (including records
created during the day on that date). <br>
Example: Last modification</span><br><b>2012-02-07</b> - [empty]<br>will retrieve
all records edited from February 7, 2012 to today.</p>



<p><b>Single date ("to")</b><span>: If you fill in only the right-hand
field (the "to"), you will get all records modified or created <b>up to </b>that date at midnight.</span><br>Example:
Last modification<br><span>[empty] - &nbsp;<b>2012-02-07</b></span><br>will
retrieve
all records edited from the beginning of time up to February 7, 2012
at midnight (meaning no records created during the work day on February 7 will
be included).</p>



<p><b>Date range</b>: Note that since the day is set at midnight, to
search for all sources created on February 7, 2012, for example, you must enter
the start date 2012-02-07 (understood as midnight on February 7) and the end
date 2012-02-08 (understood as midnight on February 8). This will include all
sources created during the day. A search from 2012-02-07 to 2012-02-07 will be
empty! </p>



<p><b>Faceted search:</b> If you cannot find what you need, use the
faceted search (top menu in the middle) as another way to search the data. If
you have editing rights for a particular source, you will see an edit button
and when you click on it you will be taken directly to the Muscat editing mode.</p>
