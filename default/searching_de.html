</h1><b>Faceted search

</b><p><span><span>The <b>Faceted search</b> (top menu in the middle) is available to search
the data in a familiar OPAC setting. </span>If you
have editing rights for a particular source, an edit button will take you directly to the Muscat editing mode.</span></p><span>An <b>incipit search</b> is available through the <a target="_blank" href="https://muscat.rism.info/advanced">Advanced search</a>. A keyboard permits the easy insertion of notation. Four search modes are available, with various degrees of fuzziness:<br>1. Exact pitch: Incipit matches the exact pitches.<br>2. Interval: Exact pitches are ignored, but intervals are searched. This permits the inclusion of <b>transpositions</b> of a given melody.<br>3. Refined pitch contour: Intervals are ignored but only the upward and downward movements of the melody are searched.<br>4. Gross pitch contour: This is the fuzziest of all. The approximate contour of the melody is searched.<br><br>At the bottom of the page, the field <b>Incipit</b>
 permits the user to enter raw Plaine &amp; Easie code (it can be copied
 and pasted from a Source, for example). The musical staff preview is 
automatically updated as in the Source editor.<br></span><br><span>All the other fields present in the Advanced Search can be combined with the incipit search.<br><br>The RISM OPAC has a simplified incipit search under the <a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=3&amp;L=0">Advanced search</a>.</span><span> Full instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=8&amp;L=0#c38">here</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HgXFyiXZq5M">video</a></span>.<br><span>Don't forget to always search for the incipit before entering an anonymous source! <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kKc0zzc8cbo">Incipit search first</a>! <br></span><p><br></p><p><b>Muscat
filters</b></p><p>The <b>Muscat
filters</b> offer simple yet powerful searching.</p>You can
enter in each field:

<ul><li>Single words</li><li>Multiple words: <br><span>either without quotations mark: <b>lass
     noch</b> (98 results)</span><br><span>or with quotation marks: <b>"lass
     noch"</b> (6 results)</span></li><li><span>Truncation with ? or *<br>
     <b>?</b>: The question mark replaces
     exactly one letter. <b>B?cher</b> will
     find Bucher and Bacher. <br><b>*</b>: The
     asterisk can be used to truncate or replace any number of letters. <b>B*cher</b> will find Bucher and Bacher
     but also Boucher and Bötticher.</span></li><li><span>AND, OR, NOT, ( ): Take
     advantage of Boolean searching. Use parenthesis to group your search.
     Examples:<br>
     Composer contains: <b>(Bach AND
     Johann) NOT Sebastian</b><br>
     To find Johann Michael Bach and Johann Christian Bach but not Johann
     Sebastian Bach<br>
     Siglum contains: <b>D-B AND (I-* OR
     F-P*) </b><br>
     To find all prints in the library D-B where there are also copies in Italy
     or Paris</span></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note
the following for these particular fields:</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Composer contains</b>: This searches only RISM's authorized form of
the name: Anonymus instead of Anonymous, Čajkovskij instead of Tchaikovsky. Use
the Personal Names authority file to find the authorized forms. </p>

<p></p><p><b>Siglum
contains</b>: Search by the letters in a siglum. This field is case-sensitive. For
example:<br><b>D-*</b> = all
sources in Germany<br><b>D-B* </b>= all
sources in German cities that start with B<br><b>D-B</b> = all
sources at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</p>

<p><b>Searching by date:</b> Enter dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The day
is set to midnight by default.<br><b>Single date ("from"): </b><span>If you fill in only the left-hand
field (the "from"), you will get all records modified or created <b>since</b> that date (including records
created during the day on that date). <br>
Example: Last modification</span><br><b>2012-02-07</b> - [empty]<br>will retrieve
all records edited from February 7, 2012 to today.</p>



<p><b>Single date ("to")</b><span>: If you fill in only the right-hand
field (the "to"), you will get all records modified or created <b>up to </b>that date at midnight.</span><br>Example:
Last modification<br><span>[empty] - &nbsp;<b>2012-02-07</b></span><br>will
retrieve
all records edited from the beginning of time up to February 7, 2012
at midnight (meaning no records created during the work day on February 7 will
be included).</p>



<p><b>Date range</b>: Note that since the day is set at midnight, to
search for all sources created on February 7, 2012, for example, you must enter
the start date 2012-02-07 (understood as midnight on February 7) and the end
date 2012-02-08 (understood as midnight on February 8). This will include all
sources created during the day. A search from 2012-02-07 to 2012-02-07 will be
empty! </p>
