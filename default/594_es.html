[TO TRANSLATE: ] <h1><a target="_blank">TOTAL SCORING (594)</a></h1>

<p><b>Voice/instrument (594 $b)<br> Required field.</b></p>

<p><span>The scoring
(also known as performing force, medium of performance, or instrumentation,
which here includes vocal parts) of a work, which was given in brief in the <b>Scoring
summary</b>,<b> </b>is given here in full. The <b>Scoring summary</b> must
therefore always correlate with the details you enter in this full description
of the scoring.</span></p>



<p><span>If the full
scoring requirements are not given, these should be ascertained from the title
or the material itself. If the scoring is not known, write <b>no indication</b>. Any uncertainty can be mentioned in more detail in
the field <b>General note (500)</b>.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Use the
autocomplete in this field to help you. An alphabetical list of abbreviations can
be found in the RISM instrument
abbreviations list. General instrumental designations (such as strings)
are always in English and individual instruments are in Italian whenever
possible. Other specific, regional instruments should be written in the
original language. </p>

<p><span>Use upper
case for vocal parts and lower case for other instrumental parts. Solo
instruments begin with <b>iSol:</b>.</span></p>



<p>

</p><p><span>If you have
a figured bass, enter the instrument as usual, such as <b>b</b>, <b>bc</b>, <b>org</b>, etc. (but see the tables in the
section <b>Figured bass in scores and/or parts </b></span>for guidance with related fields).</p>

<p></p><p></p><p><span><span>For non-C instruments, standard
tunings are listed in the abbreviation list. If the tuning in your source
deviates from the standard tuning, please list the tuning in the source (see: <b>in A</b>). For instruments that are
normally in C, "in C" does not need to be listed. If in doubt, list
the tuning. Instrument tunings should be given in English. </span>See Appendix: Keys.</span></p>

<p><span>When trying to decide
between similar terms, it is usually best to go with what is on the source. If
the name of the instrument in your source deviates from the RISM abbreviation,
you may write the term as on the source in the field <b>General note (500)</b>.</span></p>

<p>List the scoring
in the following order: </p>

<p>&nbsp;·&nbsp;
Vocal parts - solo</p>

<p>·&nbsp;
Vocal parts - chorus</p>

<p>·&nbsp;

alternative scoring possibilities to the original requirements in brackets. </p>
