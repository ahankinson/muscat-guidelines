<h4>Subject heading (650 $a) </h4>

<p><span>Enter subject keywords or genre
terms here. This field is linked to the index <b>Subjects.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>The keyword should apply to the
entire work or the original work on which a piece is based, even in the case of
arrangements, excerpts, or single movements. In the case of sections of larger
vocal works, enter the genre of the excerpt in question (such as Arias,
Marches) as well as that of the entire work. Each record should be given a
subject heading that relates to the standardized title. This field is
particularly important for works whose genre is not named in the standardized
title.</p>

<p>New entries should be made only in
consultation with the RISM Central Office. </p>
