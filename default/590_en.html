<p><b>Parts held (590 $a)</b></p>

<p>

</p><p><b>Required if source contains parts.</b></p>

<p></p><p></p><p>

</p><p><span>Enter
extant parts and number of parts here with reference to the RISM instrument abbreviation
list. If a particular part designation is not included in the list, it must be
written out in full. You may also write out in full unusual instruments,
designations, or tunings (such as cor in D|x); however, in the field <b>Scoring (594)</b>, try to standardize the
instrument to RISM's instrument abbreviation list if possible (such as cor in
E|b).</span></p>

<p><span>The first
letter of instrumental parts is in lowercase and vocal parts uppercase. If no
further details of the part designations are available, please write <b>no further indication</b>. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p>The order for naming parts is:</p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vocal
parts - solo</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vocal
parts – chorus</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solo
instruments</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strings</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basso
continuo/thoroughbass</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woodwinds</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brass</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
instruments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The order must match the information given
under <b>Format, extent (300 $a). </b>List
parts from the highest to the lowest range. Use a comma between parts and a
semicolon between groups.&nbsp; If a part
contains the parts for several instruments, use <b>and</b>.</span></p>

<p>You may place
all parts from the same group on one line or fill in only one part per line of
the table, but notice that, as in the last example, very long lines tend to get complicated and hard to follow. <br></p><p></p><p>

</p><p><span>Additional
information (brief remarks) about such things as the number or incompleteness
of parts can be added in parentheses directly after the part designation:<br>
<b>(= bc)</b>: part is a basso continuo
part<br>
<b>(incpl)</b>: part is incomplete<br>
<b>(2x)</b>: there are two copies of the
part</span></p>

<p></p>

<p></p><p>

</p><p><span>If you have
a figured bass, enter the instrument followed by <b>.fig</b>, such as <b>b.fig</b>, <b>bc.fig</b>, <b>org.fig</b>, etc. (but see the tables in the section <b>Figured bass in scores and/or parts </b></span>for guidance with related fields).</p>
