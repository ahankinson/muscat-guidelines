<p><b>Parts held (590 $a)</b></p>

<p>

</p><p><b>Required if source contains parts.</b></p>

<p></p><p><span>Enter
extant parts and number of parts here using the RISM abbreviation list along with the extent of each item (pagination/foliation). If a
particular part designation is not included in the list, it must be written out
in full. The first letter of instrumental parts is in lowercase and vocal parts
uppercase. If no further details of the part designations are available, please
write <b>no further indication</b>. </span></p>

<p>The order for naming parts is:</p><p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vocal
parts - solo</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vocal
parts – chorus</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solo
instruments</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strings</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basso
continuo/thoroughbass</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woodwinds</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brass</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other
instruments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The order must match the information given
under <b>Format, extent (300 $a). </b>List
parts from the highest to the lowest range. Use a comma between parts and a
semicolon between groups.&nbsp; If a part
contains the parts for several instruments, use <b>and</b>.</span></p>

<p>You may place
all parts from the same group on one line or fill in only one part per line of
the table, but notice that, as in the last example, very long lines tend to get complicated and hard to follow. Additional information (brief remarks) about such things as
the number or incompleteness of parts can be added in parentheses directly
after the part designation.</p>
