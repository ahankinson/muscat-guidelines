<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>Muscat offers the
possibility of selecting a template, depending on the kind of source being cataloged.
The template offers only those fields that are needed for the source at hand. </p>

<h3>Copying existing records </h3>

<p>In addition to selecting different
templates, you can copy an existing record. This can be done on the template
screen: simply enter the RISM number in the field "Create from existing
source." You will then see a copy of the record in the editing mode and
from there you can make any changes to the record that you need. The copied
record will automatically receive a new RISM ID number upon saving. Alternately,
you can copy a record in the viewing mode by clicking on the
"Duplicate" button in the sidebar on the right.</p>
