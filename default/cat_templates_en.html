<h1>Templates</h1>

<p>Muscat offers template for different sources. The
template offers only those fields that are needed for the source at hand. </p>

<p><b>Copying
existing records </b></p>

<p>In addition to selecting different templates, you can
copy an existing record. There are two ways to do this. </p>

<p>From the template selection screen: simply enter the
RISM number in the field "Create from existing source." You will then
see a copy of the record in the editing mode and from there you can make any
changes to the record that you need. The copied record will automatically
receive a new RISM ID number upon saving. </p>

<p>Alternately, you can copy a record in the viewing mode
by clicking on the "Duplicate" button in the sidebar on the right.<br></p><br>
