<h3>Record status</h3><p><span>The <b>Record status</b> determines which records
are published in the <a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4">RISM online catalog</a> and are thus publicly viewable. The
status can be changed manually.<br><br></span></p>

<p><b>Published</b><br><span>Records
from Muscat with the status <b>Published </b>are
sent for publication in the RISM catalog once a month, around the 19th of the
month (depending on weekends and holidays). The records can then be seen in the
catalog by the end of the month. All new records are automatically set to <b>Published</b>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Unpublished</b><br><span>Records
with the status <b>Unpublished</b> are
withheld from publication in the RISM online catalog. Some projects wish to
keep this status until the project is complete, or individuals might want to
wait until an item is fully cataloged before publishing it (such as with extensive
records that have lots of incipits or individual entries). </span></p>



<p>Please
use this status judiciously. It is not good practice to unpublish records that
were once publicly available, nor is it ideal to keep records unpublished for a
very long time.<br></p><br>
