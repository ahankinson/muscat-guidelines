<p><b>1. How can I add images?</b></p>

<p><span>Small
images such as watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings can be attached to
the record directly from the editing mode: click on <b>Attach a new image</b> on the menu on the right.</span></p>



<p><span>Images such
as digitized resources should only be added as links that link to the holding
repository. These are added in the field <b>External
resource (856)</b>.</span></p>

<br>

<p><b>2. How can I change the order of {items in a
collection, incipits, names, instruments, notes...}?</b></p>

<p><span>It's quite
simple: just click and drag! (Make sure you are clicking outside the white text
field). Any repeatable field (designated by a <b>+</b> sign) can be organized this way.&nbsp; <br><br></span></p>





















<p><b>3. How can I add
special characters?</b></p>

<p>Muscat supports Unicode, so make sure than any special
characters are Unicode compliant. See, for example, <a target="_blank" href="https://unicode-table.com/">unicode-table.com</a> for Unicode characters.<br><br>

</p><p><b>4. </b><b>How can I use the folders?</b></p>

<p><span>A folder can be created by selecting
records on the main Sources page, then going to <b>Batch actions</b> above the list of records (on the upper left) and
clicking on <b>Create folder with items</b>.
</span><span>You can also use&nbsp;<b>Batch actions&nbsp;</b>to add the
selected records to an existing folder.</span><span> View the items
in your folder by selecting it on the right under <b>Is in folder</b>. From there, you can sort and search as usual. After
any search in Sources, buttons under <b>Actions</b> appear: <b>Add all to new
folder</b> and <b>Add all to an existing folder</b>. This refers to all of the
records in the current list of search results. </span></p>



<p><span>On the <b>Folders</b>
page linked from the top menu, you can find your folder by typing its name in the
filter <b>Any field contains</b>. You can
also delete your own folders.</span></p>

<p><b><br></b></p><p><b>5. How can I export records from Muscat?</b></p>

<p>Single records can be viewed in XML format by appending .xml to any
record's URL in the viewing mode. You can export your
own folders containing records for sources (up to 25,000 records) in MARCXML or
CSV format.</p><p><br>

</p><p><b>6. How can I check for errors in older records?</b></p>

<p>When viewing one of your own folders, click the "Validate
items" link. You will receive an email with a list of validation errors
found.</p><p><br></p>

<p><b>7. How can I include more complex music
incipits with my records?</b></p>

<p>If you create a music incipit in a
different format (such as a full score in Sibelius) and convert it to MEI, then you can
upload the MEI file to Muscat. Currently, only the Editorial Center can do
this; please contact us for assistance. This will be
displayed as an image in the online catalog. A separate Plaine &amp; Easie
incipit would have to be made in order for it to be searchable.<br><br></p><p><b>8. How can I delete a record?</b></p><p>Please notify the RISM Editorial Center if
you need to delete a record. </p>
