<p><b>1. How can I add images?</b></p>

<p><span>Small
images such as watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings can be attached to
the record directly from the editing mode: click on <b>Attach a new image</b> on the menu on the right.</span></p>



<p><span>Images such
as digitized resources should only be added as links that link to the holding
repository. These are added in the field <b>External
resource (856)</b>.</span></p>

<br>

<p><b>2. How can I change the order of {items in a
collection, incipits, names, instruments, notes...}?</b></p>

<p><span>It's quite
simple: just click and drag! (Make sure you are clicking outside the white text
field). Any repeatable field (designated by a <b>+</b> sign) can be organized this way. &nbsp;</span></p>
