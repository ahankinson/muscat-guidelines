</p><h3>Cataloging collections</h3>

</p><p>In
RISM, a <i>collection</i>
is both an intentional collective
manuscript or anthology of multiple works
as well as an
item that contains two or more separate
pieces. The
latter means that if a manuscript for a
piano sonata, for example, also
has a sketch for a fugue at
the very end, RISM would catalog it as a
collection with a parent record for the item as a whole and
individual entries for the sonata and the
fugue. 
</p>





<p>When cataloging collections,
please note that:</p>

<ol><li>The collection main entry
     (parent record) should contain information that applies to the entire
     collection. </li><li>Any information that is
     relevant only for some parts of the collection should be entered in the
     individual entry. </li></ol>

<p>If the
works in the collection have different composers, scoring, etc., then do not
enter them in the parent record. </p>

<p>For
collections in which the works are very similar, it is a good strategy to create
a full first entry and use the "Duplicate" function to copy the
record. Then for the following records you only have to change fields such as title
and page number. </p>

<p>Collections may be made up
of separate collections. </p>

<h3>Cataloging pasticcios and compilations </h3>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>Pasticcios and compilations
are cataloged as collections. Each part is entered separately as an individual
record in a collection. More detailed guidelines on this will follow.</p><p>


	
	
	
	


</p><h3><b>Cataloging treatises</b></h3>
<p>Guidelines
for cataloging treatises are still being developed. Appropriate
subject headings for treatises include <b>Writings</b>, <b>Music
theory</b>, and <b>Theory of harmony</b>. Additional subject headings
may be added.</p><p>
