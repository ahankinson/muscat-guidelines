</p><h3>Cataloging collections</h3>

<p></p><p>In cataloging collections,
redundancy should be avoided as much as possible. Please observe the following:</p>

<ol><li>Any statements which apply to
     the entire collection should be entered in the collection main entry
     (parent record). &nbsp;</li><li>Any information that is
     relevant only for some parts of the collection should be entered in the individual
     entry. </li></ol>

<p>Collections may be made up
of separate collections. </p>

<h3>Cataloging pasticcios and compilations </h3>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>Pasticcios and compilations
are cataloged as collections. Each part is entered separately as an individual
record in a collection. More detailed guidelines on this will follow.</p>
