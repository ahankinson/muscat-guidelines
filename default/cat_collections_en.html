</p><h3>Cataloging collections</h3>

<p></p>

<p>When cataloging collections,
please note that:</p>

<ol><li>The collection main entry
     (parent record) should contain information that applies to the entire
     collection. </li><li>Any information that is
     relevant only for some parts of the collection should be entered in the
     individual entry. </li></ol>

<p>If the
works in the collection have different composers, scoring, etc., then do not
enter them in the parent record. </p>

<p>For
collections in which the works are very similar, it is a good strategy to create
a full first entry and use the "Duplicate" function to copy the
record. Then for the following records you only have to change fields such as title
and page number. </p>

<p>Collections may be made up
of separate collections. </p>

<h3>Cataloging pasticcios and compilations </h3>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>Pasticcios and compilations
are cataloged as collections. Each part is entered separately as an individual
record in a collection. More detailed guidelines on this will follow.</p>
