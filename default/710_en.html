<h4>Additional institution (710)<br></h4><p>This part
appears twice for sources. In the section <b>People and institutions</b>,<b>
</b>record all additional
institutions, organizations, or other corporate bodies involved in
the source or all other
institutions named on the source, particularly if you have
only one group in the section <b>Material description</b>
(the default in Muscat). If you have multiple groups in the
section <b>Material description</b>, you can record additional
institutions in the group with which they were involved. In other
words, decide whether the institution applies to the source as a
whole, or to a particular material group.</p><p>Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, Andr√©, etc.) are entered here.<br></p>

<p></p>

<h4>Institution (710 $a) </h4>

<p><span>Enter all names of
institutions that appear on or are associated with the source. This field is linked
to the <b>Institutions</b> authority file. Names not
yet in the authority file may be added.<br><br></span></p>

<h4>Department (710 $b) </h4>

<p>Enter, if necessary, the
name of the unit of an institution, such as a department.<br><br></p>

<h4>Attribution (710 $j) </h4>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>Select an indicator to describe the level of certainty of the attribution
if any of these situations apply. If not, leave blank.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Alleged </b>means the name is present on
     the source, but&nbsp;the attribution is questionable or doubtful.</li><li><b>Ascertained </b>means the name is partially
     present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is
     (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources,
     secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. This happens in most
     cases.</li><li><b>Conjectural </b>is a guess based on secondary
     evidence (such as secondary literature). </li><li><b>Doubtful</b>
     means attribution is in question. </li><li><b>Misattributed </b>means the name is on the source
     but is incorrect. </li></ul>
