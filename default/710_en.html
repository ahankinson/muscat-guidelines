<h4>Additional institution (710)<br></h4><p>This part
appears twice for sources. In the section <b>People and institutions</b>,<b>
</b>record all additional
institutions, organizations, or other corporate bodies involved in
the source or all other
institutions named on the source, particularly if you have
only one group in the section <b>Material description</b>
(the default in Muscat). If you have multiple groups in the
section <b>Material description</b>, you can record additional
institutions in the group with which they were involved. In other
words, decide whether the institution applies to the source as a
whole, or to a particular material group.<br><br></p>
