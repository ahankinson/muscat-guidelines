<h4>Additional personal name (700)<br></h4><p>This
part appears twice for sources. In the section <b>People and
institutions</b>,<b> </b>record
all additional people involved, in the broadest sense, as authors of
a work. You can also record here
all other people named on the source, particularly if you have
only one group in the section <b>Material description</b>
(the default in Muscat). If you have multiple groups in the
section <b>Material description</b>, you can record additional names
in the group in which they were involved. In other words, decide
whether the name applies to the source as a whole, or to a particular
material group.<br><br></p>
