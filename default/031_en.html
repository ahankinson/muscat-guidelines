<p><b>Incipit (031)</b></p>

<p>Incipits help identify works and facilitate comparison of sources. Best
practice for instrumental music is to include incipits for a high part and a
low part, such as vl 1 and bass. For vocal music, include incipits for a vocal
part and an instrumental part. Notate transposing instruments at sounding
pitch. </p>

<h4>Work
number, movement number, incipit number (031 $a, b, c)</h4>

<p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Required field if any field in this
part is used.</b></p>

<p></p><p>The incipit number consists of three digits, which stand for work, movement
and incipit. The first digit is always a 1. Movements refer to significant sections of a work, whether they are
technically movements (such as a symphony) or different sections (such as an
aria or the entry of the vocal line). To indicate that incipits sound
simultaneously (for example, a vl 1 and bass), the incipit numbers must be the
same. </p>

<p>Number
incipits consecutively even if movements are missing in the source. For example,
if the source is a three-movement symphony but the middle movement is missing,
the incipits will be numbered 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 (not 1.3.1). (Note: Periods
between the numbers are automatically added by Muscat.) </p>

<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>1.1.1 =
1st work, 1st movement, 1st incipit<br>1.1.2 =
1st work, 1st movement, 2nd incipit (sounds at the same time as 1.1.1)<br>1.1.2
=1st work, 1st movement, the entrance of the vocal part<br>1.2.1 = 1st work, 2nd movement, 1st
incipit</p>&nbsp;

<p><b>Title of movement, tempo (031 $d)</b></p>

<p><span>Enter the title
of the movement and tempo or similar indications, if specified, as it appears
on the source. Use <b>|</b> (the vertical
pipe) with a single space before and after the sign to show a line break. Use
square brackets to indicate supplements to the original; any such additions
should be spelled consistently. Multiple titles or additional tempo markings
can be added in separate fields. If you are entering multiple incipits for
which the title or tempo indication is the same, enter it only for the first
music incipit.</span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Voice/instrument (031 $m)</b></p>

<p><span>Enter the
voice part or instrument using the ???RISM abbreviation list. Enter <b>V </b>for an unknown vocal part. Enter <b>i </b>for an unknown instrumental part.
Notate transposing instruments at sounding pitch. Indicate the tuning of an
instrument in the <b>General note</b>
field.</span></p>



<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>pf<br>T coro</p>



<h4>Role (031 $e)</h4>

<p>Enter the
dramatic role here. Indicate any editorial additions with square brackets.
Indicate any questionable information with a question mark. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Text Incipit (031 $t)</h4>

<p><span>Information
from the field <b>Text (740 $a) </b>must be
repeated here. Please note that separate rules apply to texts in Latin (see
below). Note also that text incipits serve to identify the text used and do not
necessarily need to match the length of music given in the music incipit.</span> <br></p>

<p><span>Enter the
text incipit using modern spelling. Refer to the index <b>Title/text incipits</b> to help standardize your entry. Enter new texts
if they are not in the index. </span></p>

<p><span>Do not put
portions of the text in brackets or supply missing words. Omit punctuation
marks and repetitions in the text. Accents should be used only as they appear
in the dictionary or if they are grammatically correct. Write out numbers at
the beginnings of texts as words. Upper and lower case letters follow the rules
of the respective language, except that designations for God (Herr, Dio, Dieu,
Signore, Lord, etc.) always start with a capital letter. If the text incipit is
used as the standardized file<b> </b>(240),
make sure that the length and spelling agree exactly. </span></p>



<p>In Romance
languages, continue the text directly after an apostrophe and without a space.
An exception to this rule is when the first letter of a word is replaced by an
apostrophe (for example: Fra l'amante e 'l genitor). </p>



<p>Ascertained
or derived texts that do not appear on the source can be given here. In such
cases, put the entire text in square brackets. Among these are:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Texts
if a vocal part is missing </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Text
incipits in the original language of the work when the source contains a
translated version</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Texts
of vocal compositions which became the theme of a variation or the basis of an
instrumental arrangement</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Special rules for texts in Latin</u></p>

<p><span>???Enter
Latin texts, both sacred and secular. The field is linked to the file <b>Title/text incipits</b>. Within the file <b>Title/text incipits</b>, a term preceded by
the indicator <b>t </b>means that you can
get information about the exact liturgical context, variant versions, and other
matters. If the text incipit is used as the standardized title, make sure that
the spelling is identical, but remember that Latin text in standardized titles
is only entered up to the comma. Use square brackets to enter Latin texts which
are not named on the source but have been determined by research.</span></p>&nbsp;<p><b>Key or mode (031 $r) </b></p>

<p>??Select the
key or mode from the list. </p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><b>Time signature (031 $o) </b></p>

<p>Enter the
time signature of the music incipit as a fraction. If the incipit is without a
time signature, leave this field blank. Enter time signatures as fractions. The
following are also allowed: <b>3</b>, <b>c</b> (for 4/4), <b>c/</b> (for cut time or 2/2), <b>o</b> (for
3/1), <b>o/</b> (for 3/2).</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i>Examples</i>:<br>4/4<br>6/8 </p>



<p><span>If the time
signature in the source is obviously wrong, please correct it to match the
incipit given. Include an explanitory note in the field <b>General note</b>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Clef (031 $g)</b></p>

<p>Select a clef
from the list. <span>The
letter<b> </b>indicates the kind of clef. The number refers to position on the
staff line. A hyphen means modern notation. A plus sign means mensural
notation. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Key signature (031 $n)</b></p>



<p><span>Enter the
key signature of the music incipit. It begins with the control character <b>$</b>. In the second position, enter <b>x</b> for sharp keys or <b>b</b> for flat keys. Next, enter the
pitches to be raised or lowered according to the key signature. Add missing
sharps or flats in square brackets. If there is no key signature, leave the
field blank.</span></p>

<p><i>Examples:</i><br>$xFC (the
notes F and C are sharp = D major or B minor)<br>$bBEA (the
notes B, E and A are flat = E-flat major or C minor)<br><span>$bBE[A] (as
above, except that in this case only the first two flat signs occur in the
manuscript) <br>
</span><br><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Music incipit (031

() = fermata/hold/pause (only a single note letter name or a single rest can be
bracketed; accidentals, pitch indications, etc. must be outside the
parentheses; see also <b>10. Special rhythms</b>,
below)</span></p>

<p>Do not
enter slurs.</p>

<p><span><b>9. Beaming</b><br>
{ = beginning of beaming<br>

&amp; = Conventional beaming</span> <br></p>

<p><span><b>10. Special
rhythms:</b><br>
( = beginning of special rhythm</span><br>) = end of
special rhythm<br><span> <br>
The total duration value of the group must be written before the <b>(</b>. The rhythmic value of the first note
must be given after <b>(</b>, even if it is
identical with that of the note immediately before the section of special
rhythm. The number of notes in the group must be indicated before <b>)</b>. It is separated from the last note
by <b>;</b>.</span></p><i>Examples:</i><br>8(3ABCDE;5)
&nbsp; = quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a
quaver/eighth note.<span><br>8({3ABCDE};5)
= quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a quaver/eighth
note, beamed</span><br>

<p>The triplet
is a special case. Strictly speaking, it should be encoded as:<br>8(6ABC;3)
or 8({6ABC};3).<br>Instead
though, the following shortcut is permitted:<br><span>(6ABC)<br>
({6ABC})</span></p>

<p>Please do
not forget the rhythmic value within the bracket!</p>

<p><span><b>11. Shortcuts</b><br>
11.1. Repeated figures<br>
! = beginning and end of passage<br>f = repeat
indication <br>
The figure will be repeated as
often as <b>f</b> is repeated after the
second <b>!</b>. This is only possible
within a bar/measure.</span></p>

<p><span><i>Example:</i><br> !{'8ABAG}!ff = this figure will be repeated
twice</span> <br></p>

<p>11.2.
Repeated bars/measures<br>i = repeat
last bar/measure<br>'i' always
goes between two bar lines.</p>

<p><i>Example:</i><br>'4ABAG/i/i/
= the bar/measure will be repeated twice </p><br><p>11.3.
Rhythmic patterns </p>

<p>When a certain rhythmic sequence is
repeated several times, the rhythmic pattern can be given before the respective
note letter names.</p>

<p><span><i>Example:</i><br>Instead of <b>8.A6B8C8.D6E8F</b> the code can be <b>8.68ABCDEF</b><br>
The rhythmic sequence ends as soon a different rhythmic value occurs.</span></p>&nbsp;<br><b>12. Change
of clef, key or time signature:

</b><p>Use % to
change the clef, $ to change the key, and @ to change the time signature.
Follow this with the new general indication (time, key, or clef), followed by a
space.</p>

<p><span><i>Examples:</i><br>
%C-1 '2A<br>
%C-1 $xFC '8B<br>
@3/2 '1C<br>
$nBE $xFC</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><b>13.
Abbreviations </b><br>
Abbreviated forms of notation found within the music, such as tremolos or
simile signs for repeats, must be written out in full using actual notation.<br><i>Examples:</i></span><br>{'8DDDD} =
minim/ half tremolo on D</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>14. Chords</b></p>

<p><span>Do not
enter chords because neither Muscat nor the online catalog can display them.
Instead, enter only the top note of a chord. If you are curious, in Plaine
&amp; Easie Code chords are entered from the highest to the lowest note and
separated by a<b> ^</b>. <br><i>Example:</i></span><br>4’’C^’G^E^C
