<h3><b>Incipit (031)</b></h3>

<p>Incipits help identify works and facilitate comparison of sources. Best
practice for instrumental music is to include incipits for a high part and a
low part, such as vl 1 and bass. For vocal music, include incipits for a vocal
part and an instrumental part. Notate transposing instruments at sounding
pitch. <br></p><p></p><p>

</p><p>If the notation you need is not available using the Plaine &amp; Easie
code, transcribe the music the best you can and include an explanatory note. You
can attach an image of the incipit from the source for further clarification.<br><br></p>

<p></p>

<h4>Work
number, movement number, incipit number (031 $a, b, c)</h4>

<p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Required field if any field in this
part is used.</b></p>

<p></p><p>The incipit number consists of three digits, which stand for work, movement
and incipit. The first digit is always a 1. Movements refer to significant sections of a work, whether they are
technically movements (such as a symphony) or different sections (such as an
aria or the entry of the vocal line). To indicate that incipits sound
simultaneously (for example, a vl 1 and bass), the first and the second incipit numbers must be the
same. </p>

<p>Number
incipits consecutively even if movements are missing in the source. For example,
if the source is a three-movement symphony but the middle movement is missing,
the incipits will be numbered 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 (not 1.3.1). (Note: Periods
between the numbers are automatically added by Muscat.) </p>

<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>1.1.1 =
1st work, 1st movement, 1st incipit<br>1.1.2 =
1st work, 1st movement, 2nd incipit (sounds at the same time as 1.1.1)<br>1.1.2
=1st work, 1st movement, the entrance of the vocal part<br>1.2.1 = 1st work, 2nd movement, 1st
incipit</p>&nbsp;

<h4><b>Title of movement, tempo (031 $d)</b></h4>

<p><span>Enter the title
of the movement and tempo or similar indications, if specified, as it appears
on the source. Use <b>|</b> (the vertical
pipe) with a single space before and after the sign to show a line break. Use
square brackets to indicate supplements to the original; any such additions
should be spelled consistently. Multiple titles or additional tempo markings
can be added in separate fields. If you are entering multiple incipits for
which the title or tempo indication is the same, enter it only for the first
music incipit.</span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Voice/instrument (031 $m)</b></h4>

<p>Enter the
voice part or instrument using the <span><span>list of <b>RISM instrument abbreviations</b>. </span> Enter <b>V </b>for an unknown vocal part. Enter <b>i </b>for an unknown instrumental part.
Notate transposing instruments at sounding pitch. Indicate the tuning of an
instrument in the <b>General note</b>
field.</span></p>

<h4>Role (031 $e)</h4>

<p></p><p>

</p><p><span>Enter the standardized
dramatic role name here. If you fill out this field, make sure to also fill out
the field <b>Dramatic roles named (595)</b>.
Indicate any editorial additions with square brackets. Indicate any
questionable information with a question mark. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Text Incipit (031 $t)</h4>

<p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>A text
incipit consists of the first few words of the piece or section and
can be the first line, first phrase, or other group of words that
make linguistic sense. Text incipits serve to identify the text used
and do not necessarily need to match the length of music given in the
music incipit. Text
incipits can be included regardless of whether a music incipit is
entered. Please note that separate rules apply to texts in
Latin (see below). 
</p>



<p><span>  Text incipits are given in standardized form. Enter the
text incipit using modern spelling. Refer to the index <b>Title/text incipits</b> to help standardize your entry. Enter new incipits
if they are not in the index. </span></p>

<p>Do not put
portions of the text in brackets or supply missing words. Omit punctuation
marks and repetitions in the text. Accents should be used only as they appear
in the dictionary or if they are grammatically correct. Write out numbers at
the beginnings of texts as words. Upper and lower case letters follow the rules
of the respective language, except that designations for God (Herr, Dio, Dieu,
Signore, Lord, etc.) always start with a capital letter. If the text incipit is
used as the standardized title (240),
make sure that the length and spelling agree exactly. <br></p><p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>Omit
the text entirely if you cannot read it and add a note saying "Text
illegible" or similar.</p>





<p>In Romance
languages, continue the text directly after an apostrophe and without a space.
An exception to this rule is when the first letter of a word is replaced by an
apostrophe (for example: Fra l'amante e 'l genitor). </p>



<p>Ascertained
or derived texts that do not appear on the source can be given here. In such
cases, put the entire text in square brackets. Among these are:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Texts
if a vocal part is missing </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Text
incipits in the original language of the work when the source contains a
translated version</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Texts
of vocal compositions which became the theme of a variation or the basis of an
instrumental arrangement</p>

<p><br></p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Non-Latin scripts:</b><span> If your source has a text incipit that uses
non-Latin letters or characters (Cyrillic/Greek/Hebrew/Korean etc. alphabet,
Chinese characters, etc.) enter the <b>Text
incipit</b> using the original script. Translations or transliterations are
optional and may be added in additional text incipit fields. Add translations not on the source in brackets. You may translate into any of the RISM languages.</span></p>&nbsp;

<br><p></p>

<p><b>Special rules for texts in Latin: </b><span>Enter
Latin texts, both sacred and secular. The field is linked to the file <b>Title/text incipits</b>. Within the file <b>Title/text incipits</b>, a term preceded by
the indicator <b>t </b>means that you can
get information about the exact liturgical context, variant versions, and other
matters. If the text incipit is used as the standardized title, make sure that
the spelling is identical, but remember that Latin text in standardized titles
is only entered up to the comma. Use square brackets to enter Latin texts which
are not named on the source but have been determined by research.</span></p><p>

</p><p><span>Standard
Latin texts usually match the texts in the <i>Liber
usualis</i>. In RISM, these texts usually contain a comma. For example, when
you search for the text "Et in terra pax", you will see about a dozen
options, but only 1 has a comma and this source is used 4,800 times in the
database. Therefore it is the one we want – presuming this matches your source.
If your text incipit is only "Et in terra pax" then this means your
source (1) contains only these words or (2) continues in a way that is
different form the <i>Liber usualis</i>. This is of course possible, but in most cases
you want the version with the comma.</span></p><p><br></p><p><b>The following applies to imported data: </b>Information from the field
<b>Text (740 $a)</b>, if
used,<b> </b>must be repeated here. <br></p><p><br></p>

<h4><b>Key or mode (031 $r) </b></h4>

<p>Select the
key or mode from the list. <br><br></p>

<h4><b>Key signature (031 $n)</b></h4>



<p><span>Enter the
key signature of the music incipit. It begins with the control character <b>$</b>. In the second position, enter <b>x</b> for sharp keys or <b>b</b> for flat keys. Next, enter the
pitches to be raised or lowered according to the key signature. Add missing
sharps or flats in square brackets. If there is no key signature, leave the
field blank.</span></p>

<i>Examples:</i><br>$xFC (the
notes F and C are sharp = D major or B minor)<br>$bBEA (the
notes B, E and A are flat = E-flat major or C minor)<br>$bBE[A] (as
above, except that in this case only the first two flat signs occur in the
manuscript) 

<h4><b><br>Time signature (031 $o) </b></h4>

<p></p><p>

</p><p><span>Enter
time signatures as fractions. The following are also allowed: <b>3</b>, <b>c</b>
(for 4/4), <b>c/</b> (for cut time or 2/2),
<b>o</b> (for 3/1), <b>o/</b> (for 3/2). If the incipit is without a time signature, leave
this field blank. </span></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>Examples</i>:<br>4/4<br>6/8 </p>



<p><span>If the time
signature in the source is obviously wrong, please correct it to match the
incipit given. Include an explanatory note in the field <b>General note</b>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b>Clef (031 $g)</b></h4>

<p>Select a clef
from the list. <span>The
letter<b> </b>indicates the kind of clef. The number refers to position on the
staff line. A hyphen means modern notation. A plus sign means mensural
notation. </span></p>

<p><span><b>8. Other
symbols</b><br>
t = trill (immediately follows the note)<br>
+ = tie (immediately follows the note, not to be confused with a slur.) <br>
() = fermata/hold/pause (only a single note letter name or a single rest can be
bracketed; accidentals, pitch indications, etc. must be outside the

enter slurs.</p>

<p><span><b>9. Beaming</b><br>
{ = beginning of beaming<br>

<p><span><b>10. Special
rhythms:</b><br>
( = beginning of special rhythm</span><br>) = end of
special rhythm<br><span> <br>
The total duration value of the group must be written before the <b>(</b>. The rhythmic value of the first note
must be given after <b>(</b>, even if it is
identical with that of the note immediately before the section of special
rhythm. The number of notes in the group must be indicated before <b>)</b>. It is separated from the last note
by <b>;</b>.</span></p><i>Examples:</i><br>8(3ABCDE;5)
&nbsp; = quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a
quaver/eighth note.<span><br>8({3ABCDE};5)
= quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a quaver/eighth
note, beamed</span><br>

<p>The triplet
is a special case. Strictly speaking, it should be encoded as:<br>8(6ABC;3)
or 8({6ABC};3).<br>Instead
though, the following shortcut is permitted:<br><span>(6ABC)<br>
({6ABC})</span></p>

<p>Please do
not forget the rhythmic value within the bracket!</p>

<p><span><b>11. Shortcuts</b><br><span><b>Note:</b> Currently, the OPAC search
ignores the repeated elements described in 11.1 and 11.2. This means that if
you use those shortcuts, your incipits will not be fully searchable by the
OPAC. Until this is fixed, please write out the incipit in full.&nbsp; (Shortcut 11.3 may be used as described.)</span>
<br><br>11.1. Repeated figures<br>
! = beginning and end of passage<br>f = repeat
indication <br>
The figure will be repeated as
often as <b>f</b> is repeated after the
second <b>!</b>. This is only possible
within a bar/measure.</span></p>

<p><span><i>Example:</i><br> !{'8ABAG}!ff = this figure will be repeated
twice</span> <br></p>

<p>11.2.
Repeated bars/measures<br>i = repeat
last bar/measure<br>'i' always
goes between two bar lines.</p>

<p><i>Example:</i><br>'4ABAG/i/i/
= the bar/measure will be repeated twice </p><br><p>11.3.
Rhythmic patterns </p>

<p>When a certain rhythmic sequence is
repeated several times, the rhythmic pattern can be given before the respective
note letter names.</p>

<p><span><i>Example:</i><br>Instead of <b>8.A6B8C8.D6E8F</b> the code can be <b>8.68ABCDEF</b><br>
The rhythmic sequence ends as soon a different rhythmic value occurs.</span></p>&nbsp;<br><b>12. Change
of clef, key or time signature:

</b><p>Use % to
change the clef, $ to change the key, and @ to change the time signature.
Follow this with the new general indication (time, key, or clef), followed by a
space.</p>

<p><span><i>Examples:</i><br>
%C-1 '2A<br>
%C-1 $xFC '8B<br>
@3/2 '1C<br>
$nBE $xFC</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><b>13.
Abbreviations </b><br>
Abbreviated forms of notation found within the music, such as tremolos or
simile signs for repeats, must be written out in full using actual notation.<br><i>Examples:</i></span><br>{'8DDDD} =
minim/ half tremolo on D</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>14. Chords</b></p>

<p><span>Do not
enter chords because neither Muscat nor the online catalog can display them.
Instead, enter only the top note of a chord. If you are curious, in Plaine
&amp; Easie Code chords are entered from the highest to the lowest note and
