<h1>RISM Best Practices</h1>

<p><b>1. Free
text fields and indexed fields</b><br><span>If you name
a person or institution in your record (such as in a notes field), make sure to
also enter the name in the indexed fields <b>Additional
personal name (700)</b> or <b>Additional
institution (710)</b>.<br></span></p><p><span>The same
applies for citing secondary literature: if you refer to a publication in a
notes field, make sure to also enter it in the field <b>Bibliographic reference (691)</b>.</span></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>2. URLs and
links to external resources</b><br><span>Always use
permalinks when linking to digitized music, in particular for the field <b>External resource (856)</b>.</span><br><br><span>If you want
to link to a different website, do not enter the URL in a notes field. Rather,
enter the resource as a bibliographic reference by entering it in the <b>Secondary literature</b> database. Then,
link to it in the field <b>Bibliographic
reference (691)</b> and refer to it by its short title in a notes field. This
provides users with access to complete bibliographic information, and if the
URL changes then we only have to change it once in the bibliographic record.</span> <br></p>

<p><span>For books
found on Google Books or other online repositories, always create a
bibliographic record in the <b>Secondary
literature</b> database for the book itself and not the repository; i.e. cite
the book and not Google Books. <br></span></p><p><br>


	
	
	
	


</p><p><b>3.
Languages</b><br>RISM
requires some set terms to be in English, and such cases are always
mentioned in the guidelines. In other fields, particularly notes
fields, you are free to to write in any of the official RISM
languages (English, German, French) or any other common European
language such as Spanish or Italian. You may also write in a
different language if you include a translation into English, German,
or French.<br></p><br>
