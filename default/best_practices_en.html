<h1>RISM Best Practices</h1>

<p><b>1. Free
text fields and indexed fields</b><br><span>If you name
a person or institution in your record (such as in a notes field), make sure to
also enter the name in the indexed fields <b>Additional
personal name (700)</b> or <b>Additional
institution (710)</b>.<br></span></p><p><span>The same
applies for citing secondary literature: if you refer to a publication in a
notes field, make sure to also enter it in the field <b>Bibliographic reference (691)</b>.</span></p>

<p><b>2. Citing secondary literature</b><br>Information that is not found on the source may be included in the RISM record but a Bibliographic reference (691) should be added. For example, if the composer of a manuscript is known through a book, or if the publication year for an imprint is given in a catalog, the source of the information should be made clear through a note (500) and an indexed reference (691). <br></p>

<p><b>3. URLs and
links to external resources</b><br><span>Always use
permalinks when linking to digitized music, in particular for the field <b>External resource (856)</b>.</span><br><br><span>If you want
to link to a different website, do not enter the URL in a notes field. Rather,
enter the resource as a bibliographic reference by entering it in the <b>Secondary literature</b> database. Then,
link to it in the field <b>Bibliographic
reference (691)</b> and refer to it by its short title in a notes field. This
provides users with access to complete bibliographic information, and if the
URL changes then we only have to change it once in the bibliographic record.</span> <br></p>

<p><span>For books
found on Google Books or other online repositories, always create a
bibliographic record in the <b>Secondary
literature</b> database for the book itself and not the repository; i.e. cite
the book and not Google Books. <br></span></p><p><br>

</p><p><span><b>4. Making identifications </b><br>
Important information such as names of composers or titles of pieces is not
always named on the source itself. It is sometimes possible to make
identifications based on the secondary literature, reference sources, other
RISM records, or even archival sources you have access to. If you draw upon such
resources, always be clear in the record about what you used to make the
identification: name the resource in a <b>General
note (500)</b> and add a <b>Bibliographic
reference (691) </b>if appropriate. Make sure it is clear for later RISM users
how you came to your conclusions. </span></p>
