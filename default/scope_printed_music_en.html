of printed music in RISM</b></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">RISM
seeks to document printed music from the beginnings of music printing
through around 1900. </span>
</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">In
the course of the 20th century and up to today, </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">we
see a </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">sharp
increase in commercial music publishing and distribution. The amount
of music considered "rare" or undocumented </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">elsewhere
</span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">is
much less when compared to previous centuries. </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Music
published by modern publishers, printed in large quantities, widely available, and </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">meant
for active use by library patrons </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">would be better documented in cooperative
databases such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a>. </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"></span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"></span></p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">RISM
will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether to document music
published in the 20th century by defunct publishers or by smaller,
regional publishers of historical </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">significance</span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">; as well as </span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">modern editions included in the course of
cataloging a collection with historical value, such as the private
library of an individual.</span><br></p><br>
