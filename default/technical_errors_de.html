save my work</b><br>Make sure
you are using either Firefox or Chrome. Internet Explorer will not let you save
anything! </p>



<p><b>2. The
fields stretch all the way across a page and cut into other text</b><br>This might
be a screen resolution issue. Muscat works best on screens that are at
least 1366 x 768 pixels. Other resolutions might lead to display issues.</p>



<p><b>3. I can't scroll down the screen</b><br>This also might be a screen resolution issue. See #2.</p>



<p><b>4. My screen is gray and all I see is an hourglass.</b><br>This happens when you are searching in the indexes. Check to see if another
window is open. From that window, navigate back to the main screen.</p><b>5. My incipit seems to have stalled.</b><br>Try clicking the "refresh" arrows, or save your record and try
entering the incipit again.
