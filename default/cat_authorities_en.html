The <b>Authorities</b> section of
Muscat collects all authority files, controlled vocabulary, and indexes. We
like to think of it as mini databases within Muscat. 

See the corresponding
sections on the left for more details.<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Subject headings</b></p>

<p>All subject headings, forms, and genres are
collected here. Some records include explanations as to the scope of the
subject heading. If you need a subject heading that is not in our list, please
let us know and we will create one for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Images</b></p>

<p><span>The images database collects all the images
(usually watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings) that catalogers upload
into Muscat and attach to their records through the <b>Attatch a new image</b> link in the source editing mode.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Institutions</b><b> </b>

<p>The authority file for institutions (corporate
names) records non-persons that appear in connection with a source.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Liturgical festivals</b><b><span> <br>
</span></b>The index of &nbsp;liturgical festivals collects religious
holidays and feast days. New liturgical festivals may be added in consultation
with the Central Office. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Personal names </b></p>

<p><span>New authority records for
people are created when you enter a new name when cataloging a source, or when
you click <b>Create</b> to create a new
record in the personal names authority file. </span></p>

<p>In the
editing mode for personal names, you can search and import data from VIAF
through a button on the sidebar. You are also free to fill out as much
information in the authority record as you wish. </p>

<p>After you
enter a new name, you can edit it for the next four weeks. This is useful if
you find alternate spellings of a name, for example, or if you have additional
biographical information you wish to add. After that, control of the record
goes to the Central Office. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated
through the comment function or by sending an e-mail to
alexander.marxen@rism.info.</p>&nbsp;

<p><b>Places</b></p>

<p>The index of places collects the names of
locations, including histoircal geographic names.</p>
