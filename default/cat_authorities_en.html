<h1>Authorities</h1>

<h3>People </h3>

<p><span>New authority records for
people are created when you enter a new name when cataloging a source, or when
you click <b>Create</b> to create a new
record in the People authority file. </span></p>

<p>In the
editing mode for personal names, you can search and import data from VIAF
through a button on the sidebar. You are also free to fill out as much
information in the authority record as you wish. </p>

<p>After you
enter a new name, you can edit it for the next four weeks. This is useful if
you find alternate spellings of a name, for example, or if you have additional
biographical information you wish to add. After that, control of the record
goes to the Central Office. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated
through the comment function or by sending an e-mail to
alexander.marxen@rism.info.</p>
