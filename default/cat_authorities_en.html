<div>The <b>Authorities</b> section of
Muscat collects all authority files, controlled vocabulary, and indexes. We
like to think of it as mini databases within Muscat. <b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><h3><b>Images</b></h3>

<p><span>The images database collects all the images
(usually watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings) that catalogers upload
into Muscat and attach to their records through the <b>Attach a new image</b> link in the source editing mode.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Institutions</b><b> </b></h3>

<p>The authority file for institutions (corporate
names) is for non-persons that appear in connection with a source.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Liturgical festivals</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h3><p><b>
</b>The index of &nbsp;liturgical festivals collects religious
holidays and feast days. New liturgical festivals may be added in consultation
with the Central Office. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><b>Personal names </b></h3>

<p><span>New authority records for
people are created when you enter a new name when cataloging a source, or when
you click <b>Create</b> to create a new
record in the personal names authority file. </span></p>

<p>In the
editing mode for personal names, you can search and import data from VIAF
through a button on the sidebar. You are also free to fill out as much
information in the authority record as you wish. </p>

<p>After you
enter a new name, you can edit it for the next two months. This is useful if
you find alternate spellings of a name, for example, or if you have additional
biographical information you wish to add. After that, control of the record
goes to the Central Office. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated
through the comment function or by sending an e-mail to
alexander.marxen@rism.info.</p>&nbsp;

<h3><b>Places</b></h3>

<p>The index of places collects the names of
locations, including historical geographic names.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Secondary literature</b><b> </b></h3>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>This bibliographic
database contains information about all forms of secondary literature: catalogs
of works, thematic catalogs, books, articles, encyclopedias, online resources,
critical editions, modern performing editions, etc.&nbsp; By clicking on "Create," a new work
of secondary literature may be added. </p><br><h3><b>Subject headings</b></h3>

<p>All subject headings, forms, and genres are
collected here. Some records include explanations as to the scope of the
subject heading. If you need a subject heading that is not in our list, please
let us know and we will create one for you.</p><p><br></p><b></b><h3><b>Titles / Text incipits</b><b> </b></h3>

<p><span>This
authority file contains both the titles entered in the field <b>Standardized title (240 $a)</b> and the
text incipits entered in the field <b>Text
incipit (031 $t)</b>. <br></span></p><p><br></p><p>

</p><h3><b>Works</b></h3>

<p>An authority record for a work is for all information that is true for
a work as a whole, no matter what other forms a piece of music exists in,
whether it be—for example—an arrangement, a translation, a full score, or a
single manuscript. Authority records can include the composer, title, title
variants, key, instrumentation, and incipits, though it is not always an easy
matter to decide what constitutes a separate "work."</p>

<p>Associating a musical source in Muscat
with an authority record for a work ensures that all instances of any given
piece of music are linked together. This improves the searchability of the
catalog and helps users find all relevant sources, regardless of whether, for
example, one manuscript calls the famous Mozart opera "Die
Zauberflöte" and another is labeled "The Magic Flute," or a
small chamber music piece is called a "duet" on one manuscript but a
"sonata" on another. Beyond Muscat, in the linked data environment, information on
works—and the associated RISM records—can be integrated into web searches,
online encyclopedias, and other external databases.</p>

<p>

</p><p>Links to authority records for works are
made in the field 930 in every bibliographic record for a musical source. Works
not in the authority file must be created first before a link can be made.</p>

<h4><b>Creating a new authority record for a work</b></h4>

<p>Please contact the RISM Central Office
if you wish to create authority records for works.</p><p>Please refer, in general, to the
guidelines for the respective field in the Sources module.</p>

<p>

</p><p><span>When you open a template to create a
new authority record for a work, use the <b>VIAF
search</b> to look in VIAF to see if the work is already there, and click <b>select</b> to transfer the data to your
authority record and make the link to VIAF. Note that only the field 100 is
searched (i.e., composer name, scoring summary, opus/thematic catalog number,
key, and title), so searching for variants is not possible. Keep in mind that
different VIAF contributors have different ways of expressing works, so expect variations
in the formulation of titles, instruments, and even thematic indexes. A good
strategy is to search by composer name plus the number of the opus/thematic
index. </span></p>

<p><span>After you import the data from VIAF,
note that it may be necessary to clean up some fields in the field <b>Heading (100)</b> to conform to RISM
standards. Do not delete or edit imported information in the field <b>Name variants (400)</b>.</span><br></p><br>
