<h1>Searching</h1>

<p>The Muscat
filters offer simple yet powerful searching.</p>You can
enter:

<ul><li>Single words</li><li><span>Truncation with ? or *<br>
     <b>?</b>: The question mark replaces
     exactly one letter. <b>B?cher</b> will
     find Bucher and Bacher. <br><b>*</b>: The
     asterisk can be used to truncate or replace any number of letters. <b>B*cher</b> will find Bucher and Bacher
     but also Boucher and Bötticher.</span></li><li><span>Strings: <b>bella guerriera </b>(13 results)<b> </b>or <b>"bella guerriera"
     </b>(3 results)</span></li><li><span>AND, OR, NOT, ( ): Take
     advantage of Boolean searching. Use parenthesis to group your search.
     Examples:<br>
     Composer contains: <b>(Bach AND
     Johann) NOT Sebastian</b><br>
     To find Johann Michael Bach and Johann Christian Bach but not Johann
     Sebastian Bach<br>
     Siglum contains: <b>D-B AND (I-* OR
     F-P*) </b><br>
     To find all prints in the library D-B where there are also copies in Italy
     or Paris</span></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note
the following for these particular fields:</p><p></p><p>

</p><p><b>Composer contains</b>: This searches only RISM's authorized form of
the name: Anonymus instead of Anonymous, Čajkovskij instead of Tchaikovsky. Use
the Personal Names authority file to find the authorized forms. </p>

<p></p><p><b>Siglum
contains</b>: Search by the letters in a siglum. This field is case-sensitive. For
example:<br><b>D-*</b> = all
sources in Germany<br><b>D-B* </b>= all
sources in German cities that start with B<br><b>D-B</b> = all
sources at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b>Faceted search:</b> If you cannot find what you need, use the
faceted search (top menu in the middle) as another way to search the data. If
you have editing rights for a particular source, you will see an edit button
and when you click on it you will be taken directly to the Muscat editing mode.</p>
