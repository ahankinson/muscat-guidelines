<p><b>Searching </b><span>in Muscat is available through a <b>faceted search</b> and through <b>filters</b>. <br><br></span></p><h4>Faceted search</h4><h4></h4>

<p></p><p><span><span>The <b>Faceted search</b> (top menu in the middle) is available to search
the data in a familiar OPAC setting. </span>If you
have editing rights for a particular source, an edit button will take you directly to the Muscat editing mode.</span></p><span>An <b>incipit search</b> is available through the <a target="_blank" href="https://muscat.rism.info/advanced">Advanced search</a>. A keyboard permits the easy insertion of notation. Four search modes are available, with various degrees of fuzziness:<br>1. Exact pitch: Incipit matches the exact pitches.<br>2. Interval: Exact pitches are ignored, but intervals are searched. This permits the inclusion of <b>transpositions</b> of a given melody.<br>3. Refined pitch contour: Intervals are ignored but only the upward and downward movements of the melody are searched.<br>4. Gross pitch contour: This is the fuzziest of all. The approximate contour of the melody is searched.<br><br>At the bottom of the page, the field <b>Incipit</b> permits the user to enter raw Plaine &amp; Easie code (it can be copied and pasted from a Source, for example). The musical staff preview is automatically updated as in the Source editor.<br></span><br><span>All the other fields present in the Advanced Search can be combined with the incipit search.<br><br>The RISM OPAC has a simplified incipit search under the <a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=3&amp;L=0">Advanced search</a>.</span><span> Full instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=8&amp;L=0#c38">here</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/HgXFyiXZq5M">video</a></span>.<br><p><span>Don't forget to always search for the incipit before entering an anonymous source! <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/kKc0zzc8cbo">Incipit search first</a>! <br><br></span></p>



<h4><span>Muscat filters<br></span></h4><p><span>The Muscat <b>filters</b> offer simple yet powerful
searching.</span></p>



<p>You can
enter in each field:</p>

<ul><li>Single words</li><li><span>Multiple words: <br>
     either without quotations mark: <b>lass
     noch</b> (98 results)<br>
     or with quotation marks: <b>"lass
     noch"</b> (6 results)</span></li><li><span>Truncation with ? or *<br>
     <b>?</b>: The question mark replaces
     exactly one letter. <b>B?cher</b> will
     find Bucher and Bacher. <b>*</b>: The
     asterisk can be used to truncate or replace any number of letters. <b>B*cher</b> will find Bucher and Bacher
     but also Boucher and Bötticher.</span></li><li><span>AND, OR, NOT, ( ): Take
     advantage of Boolean searching. Use parenthesis to group your search.
     Examples:<br>
     Composer contains: <b>(Bach AND
     Johann) NOT Sebastian</b><br>
     To find Johann Michael Bach and Johann Christian Bach but not Johann
     Sebastian Bach<br>
     Siglum contains: <b>D-B AND (I-* OR
     F-P*) </b><br>
     To find all prints in the library D-B where there are also copies in Italy
     or Paris</span></li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note
the following for all sections:</p>

<ul><li><b>Date</b></li><ul><li><b>Searching by date:</b> Enter dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The day is set to midnight
      by default.</li><li><b>Single date ("from"): </b><span>If you fill in only the left-hand field
      (the "from"), you will get all records modified or created <b>since</b> that date (including
      records created during the day on that date). <br>
      Example: Last modification <br>
      <b>2012-02-07</b> - [empty]<br>
      will </span>retrieve all records edited from February
      7, 2012 to today.</li><li><b>Single date ("to")</b><span>: If you fill in only the right-hand
      field (the "to"), you will get all records modified or created <b>up to </b>that date at midnight.<br>
      Example: Last modification<br>
      [empty] -&nbsp; <b>2012-02-07<br>
      </b>will </span>retrieve
      all records
      edited from the beginning of time up to February 7, 2012 at midnight
      (meaning no records created during the work day on February 7 will be
      included).</li><li><b>Date range</b>: Note that since the day is set at midnight, to search for all
records created on February 7, 2012, for example, you must enter the
      start date 2012-02-07 (understood as midnight on February 7) and the end
      date 2012-02-08 (understood as midnight on February 8). This will include
      all sources created during the day. A search from 2012-02-07 to
      2012-02-07 will be empty! </li></ul></ul>
