<h4>General note (500 $a) </h4>

<p><span>Any
information on a source which could not be entered in other fields can be given
here. This includes quotations from the manuscript, which should be marked as
quotations and provided with location on the source. When providing such
information, use <b>| </b>(the vertical pipe) with a single space before and
after the sign to show a line break. Supplements to the original quotation
should always be in square brackets.</span></p><p>

<p>When
cataloging the holdings of a single library, try to keep the expressions used
as uniform as possible. The official RISM languages are German, English, and
French, and they must be used for external comments. Please avoid changing
between languages. Notes may be written in another language as long as a
translation is provided in one of the official languages.</p>



<p>When
referring to other sources in RISM, it is good practice to give not only the
RISM number, but also the country, library siglum, and the complete shelfmark.
When doing this, always put a hyphen between the country and library sigla. <br></p><p></p><p>
