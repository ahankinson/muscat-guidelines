<h4>Parent record (773 $w) </h4>

<p><span>This field
links the record to a parent record (also called main entry) in cases such as individual
records that are part of a collection and items that are part of a composite
volume. Always link to the next highest level. <br>
<br>
Link an individual record to a collection by entering the RISM number of the
collection record. <br>
<br>
If you have a composite volume that contains two collections and three
individual records, both the two collections as well as the individual records
will be linked to the composite volume. The collections within the composite
volume will of course have individual records linked to them as well. </span></p>
