<p><b>When to input a new record (printed music)</b></p>
<p>
RISM treats each manuscript as a unique item and
therefore each manuscript has its own RISM record. Printed materials
are different, however, in that multiple copies of the same edition
can be described using the same record (in which case
you simply add your holdings information),
but significant variants mean that a new record must be created.</p>

<p>The
following offers guidelines as to which variants justify a new record
and which do not. (This section draws heavily from <a target="_blank" href="http://rbms.info/dcrm/">Descriptive
Cataloging of Rare Materials (Music)</a>).</p>

<p><b>A
new record is required</b> if your
item shows one or more of these differences when
compared to the RISM record:<br>

	</p><ul><li><p><b>Different content</b>:
	Differences in the title or authors/contributors. Edition statement 
	that indicates corrections, revisions, expansions, abridgments, or
	the inclusion of supplementary materials</p></li><li><b>Different publisher.</b></li><li>
<p>
	<b>Different setting of the printing type</b>: Different plates (excluding
replacement plates). Changes in the statement of extent. Change in bibliographical or
	musical format. Differences in music line-endings and catchwords
	(revealed by the comparison of multiple copies).</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	<b>Different publication status</b>:
	An original title page has been
	canceled and replaced. A new label is covering the original
	publication, distribution, production, etc., statement. Original
	sheets have been issued in a new publisher’s cover bearing more
	recent information than that provided on the title page. Series
	title page is new.</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	<b>Different plate and/or publisher numbers</b>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><br>
<b>Do
not create a new record</b> if your item
has one of these differences. (If
your item has <i>more
than one</i>
of these differences, you must decide if a new record is necessary.)</p>
<ul><li>
<p>
	Different statement of printing: For example,
	"Fifth printing"</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Different printer or other manufacturer but same
	publisher 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Different printing date but same publication date
	
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Different publisher’s cover that does not
	provide evidence of a discrete publishing unit (for example, a
	change of color in publisher’s cloth)</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Different binding</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Different publisher’s
	advertisements or
	catalogs (unless they are integral to the publication)</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Corrections made in the course of a single press
	run (stop-press corrections)</p>
	</li><li>
<p>
	Presence or absence of
	an errata slip</p>
</li></ul><br>
<p>
These guidelines mean
that a single record will be used to represent multiple impressions,
states, and binding variants relating to a single edition or issue.
In your holdings information, you can enter details about variants
and information specific to your copy.<br><br></p><p>
