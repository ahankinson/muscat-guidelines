This field is also used to define the method for
citing a thematic catalog or catalog of works. This ensures that all RISM
contributors who use the catalog cite the catalog in the same way. When
determining the citation style, keep in mind the style and outline of the
catalog. Try to give examples that reflect the variety of kinds of works in the
catalog. Only use page numbers as a last resort. (Guidelines will follow, but look at BWV, AWV, MH, and
SheH for examples.)<br><br>
